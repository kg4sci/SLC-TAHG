{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "oxidative phosphorylation", "key2": "acute myeloid leukemia (AML)", "summary": "As acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and stem cells have an increased reliance on oxidative phosphorylation, we sought to evaluate polymerase γ inhibitors in AML.\nHere, we demonstrate that the inhibition of autophagy induces an accumulation of lipid droplets (LD) due to a decrease in fatty acid β-oxidation, that leads to a reduction of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPHOS) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but not in normal cells.\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells have an atypical metabolic phenotype characterized by increased mitochondrial mass, as well as a greater reliance on oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) for survival.\nThe palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC21 regulates oxidative phosphorylation to induce differentiation block and stemness in AML.\nTargeting ERRα promotes cytotoxic effects against acute myeloid leukemia through suppressing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.\nInhibition of the Nrf2-ALDH2/PolG2 pathway reduced AML metabolic fitness and oxidative phosphorylation levels, highlighting the key role of this pathway in promoting cell survival.\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are highly dependent on oxidative phosphorylation and the mitochondrial dynamics regulated by fusion-related genes MFN1, MFN2, and OPA1 and fission-related genes DNM1L and MFF.\nIn conclusions, we identified a downregulated expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) at relapse in AML with inv(16), and explored the in vitro effects of metformin as a potential drug to enhance chemosensitivity in this setting.\nTargeting JMJD1C-mediated metabolism via pharmacologic inhibition of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation led to ATP depletion, induced necrosis/apoptosis and decreased tumor growth in vivo in leukemias co-expressing JMJD1C and HOXA9.\nA recent study shows that loss of Erbin increases the

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "oxidative phosphorylation", "key2": "colorectal cancer(CRC)", "summary": "BCAP31 promotes colorectal cancer metastasis via oxidative phosphorylation-dependent macrophage immunosuppression.\nOverexpression of LINC01852 induces a metabolic switch from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, which attenuates the chemoresistance of CRC cells by inhibiting PKM2-mediated glycolysis.\nTICs exhibited strong stemness potential, genomic instability, and early activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and interferon signaling, accompanied by suppression of oxidative phosphorylation.\nA recent study shows that loss of Erbin increases the release of acyl-carnitine (Acar) through abolishing interaction with prothrombotic protein endothelial cell-specific adhesion molecule (ESAM), promotes mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in B cells, and ultimately suppresses lung metastasis of CRC.\nWnt/β-catenin inhibition increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and CRC cell differentiation.\nColorectal cancer (CRC) cells often exhibit altered energy metabolism, characterized by increased glycolysis and reduced oxidative phosphorylation.\nSam68 significantly promoted cell proliferation and caused a decrease of / ratio, resulting in the metabolism of glucose switched from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis in CRC cells.\nOur in vitro findings demonstrated that LAA suppressed CRC cell proliferation, induced mitochondrial oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species (ROS)), inhibited oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and induced apoptosis.\nSpecifically, blockade of ACO2 caused a reduction in TCA cycle intermediates and suppression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in an increase in glycolysis and elevated citrate flux for fatty acid and lipid synthesis.\nImportantly, NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase 3 (NSUN3) protein was identified as the target specific binding to , which inhibits oxidative phosphorylation of mitochondrial energy metabolism and enhances glycolytic activity by binding to NSUN3.\nPLD6 depletion also disrupts mitochondrial metabolic reprogram",

increased ferroptosis, thereby inhibiting CRC tumor growth.\nNotably, the COMB promoted lipid peroxidation and downregulated xCT levels, suggesting the induction of ferroptosis.\nAnd they upregulated the levels of ferroptosis makers and downregulated the expression of anti-ferroptosis proteins.\nTo investigate the molecular mechanism of TA-III as a novel ferroptosis inducer in suppressing CRC through lipophagy.\nOur findings indicate that RBMS2 inhibits CRC progression by promoting ferroptosis and regulating SLC7A11 mRNA stability.\nInactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by the inhibitor partially reversed the anti-ferroptosis effect of CPT1A overexpression.\nMARCH8 promoted CRC cell ferroptosis via inhibiting PI3K/AKT pathway by enhancing the ubiquitination and degradation of CEMIP.\nThus, HECTD3 could suppress SLC7A11 levels to attenuate the SLC7A11-mediated cyst", "dois": ["10.1016/j.cellsig.2025.112196", "10.1021/acsami.5c19528", "10.1111/1440-1681.70090",

function as a pro-oncogenic factor in various tumor types, protecting them from ferroptosis and thereby promoting tumor progression.\nHowever, due to the dual role of ferroptosis in promoting and inhibiting pancreatic tumorigenesis, regulating the degree of ferroptosis is very important to obtain the best therapeutic effect of PDAC.\nBoth the ferroptosis inhibitor and inducer exhibit antitumor effects through killing cancer cells or directly affecting tumor growth.\nThe immunosuppressive cells activated by the ferroptotic tumor cells can promote the growth of residual tumor cells, hindering the application of ferroptosis stimulation in tumor treatment.\nIn summary, our investigation has shown that c-Fos acts as a transcriptional regulator of SLC7A11, which may enhance tumour growth in pancreatic cancer by inhibiting ferroptosis.\nActivated ferroptosis induced by the inhibition of GPX4 subsequently restricts tumor progression and reduces GEM resistance in PDAC.\nStudying genetically engineered mice, we found that the deletion of a system x subunit, , induced tumor-selective ferroptosis and inhibited PDAC growth.\nTargeting SMYD2 inhibits PC progression by promoting ferritinophagy-dependent ferroptosis through the c-Myc/NCOA4 axis.\nIts knockdown induces ferroptosis in PC and suppresses tumor progression via CMTM7-mediated Wnt/β-catenin pathway.\nMore interestingly, by targeting CMTM7-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, the knockdown of SOX10 was confirmed to induce ferroptosis in PC and suppress tumor progression in vivo.\nGlutamine deprivation inhibits pancreatic cancer growth and induces ferroptosis both and .\nTherefore, CIRBP acts as a tumor suppressor gene in pancreatic cancer and induces ferroptosis through the p53/GPX4 pathway to inhibit cell growth, which may be an important target for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer.\nAlpha-Heredin suppresses PDAC progression by dual targeting of mitochondrial

HK2 protein levels.\nIn the E705 CRC cell line, it induced cell apoptosis and caused the downregulation of glycolysis, inhibiting cell proliferation.\nIn conclusion, excess iron promotes glycolysis and colon tumor growth at least partly through the inhibition of the PDH complex function.\nAndrographolide enhanced radiosensitivity by downregulating glycolysis via inhibition of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in HCT116 cells.\nIn conclusion, PTBP1 knockdown enhanced the sensitivity of drug-resistant colon cancer cells to vincristine and oxaliplatin through repression of glycolysis.\nN-acetyl-L-cysteine, an ROS inhibitor, prevented p,p'-DDT-induced promotion of aerobic glycolysis, ERK1/2 activation, upregulation, and nucleus translocation of PKM2.\nThese findings indicate that shRNA-mediated silencing of PKM2 gene promotes apoptosis and inhibits aerobic glycolysis, proliferation, migration, and invasion in CRC cells.\nMETTL14 was downregulated in CRC tissues and cells, which overexpression inhibited proliferation and glycolysis, as well as promoted apoptosis and ferroptosis in CRC cells.\nIn colon cancer cells, Abhd5 deficiency induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition by suppressing the AMPKα-p53 pathway, which is attributable to increased aerobic glycolysis.\nMoreover, miR-103a-3p knockdown inhibited the growth, proliferation, and glycolysis of CRC cells and promoted the Hippo-YAP1 signalling pathway in nude mice in a xenograft model.\nAdditionally, METTL14 restrains aerobic glycolysis in p53-WT CRC, by repressing SLC2A3 and PGAM1 expression via selectively promoting m A-YTHDF2-dependent pri-miR-6769b/pri-miR-499a processing.", "dois": ["10.1111/1440-1681.70096", "10.1016/j.canlet.2025.218104", "10.1039/d5fo03254g",

phosphorylation (OXPHOS) at relapse in AML with inv(16), and explored the in vitro effects of metformin as a potential drug to enhance chemosensitivity in this setting.\nWe also review the role of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) in maintaining leukemia stem cells (LSCs), how recurrent genomic alterations in AML alter downstream metabolism, and focus on how the BCL-2 pathway and the mitochondria are inextricably linke", "dois": ["10.3390/ijms26178301", "10.1038/s41392-025-02303-x", "10.1111/cbdd.70127", "10.1038/s41419-025-07653-6", "10.1038/s41586-025-08980-6",

patients and predicts poor prognosis, transcriptionally activates aerobic glycolysis, leading to a significant acceleration in cell proliferation and tumor growth.\nwe identify hexosaminidase B (HEXB) as a key regulator for glycolysis in glioblastoma (GBM).\nmiR-21-5p directly binds to the mRNA of PDHA1 and downregulates its transcription, thereby promoting GBM glycolysis.\niPA reduced the expression of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), which plays a key role in the regulation of aerobic glycolysis, promoting tumor cell proliferation.\nMBNL1, circNTRK2, and NTRK2-243aa were markedly downregulated and inhibited glycolysis in GBM, whereas PAX5 was upregulated and promoted glycolysis.\nThe metabolomic profiles of the PAM-treated U251SP cells were changed significantly with inhibition of the glycolysis pathway and with enhancement of the pentose phosphate pathway.\nDensely-plated glioma cells increase oxygen consumption, aerobic glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway to synthesize cholesterol, resulting in a decrease in reactive oxygen species, TCA cycle intermediates, and ATP.\nextracellular CypB can bind to the CD147 receptor, activate p-AKT, upregulate HIF-1α and DRP1 in order to promote glycolysis while inhibiting mitochondrial function to adapt to the Gln-deprived microenvironment.\nmiR-143 is significantly down-regulated in glioma tissues and glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSLCs), while miR-143 over-expression inhibits glycolysis by directly targeting hexokinase 2, and promotes differentiation of GSLCs.\nhypomethylation of the CpG island in the promoter region of U3 led to the upregulation of U3 expression in IDH1 GBM cells, and the knockdown of U3 suppressed aerobic glycol", "dois": ["10.3390/ijms26178729", "10.3934/mbe.2025091",

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "oxidative stress", "key2": "Pulmory arterial hypertension (PAH)", "summary": "Collectively, fucoxanthin suppressed hypoxia-induced oxidative stress primarily by regulating the HIF-1α-ROS pathway, thereby alleviating pulmonary remodeling in HPH.\nPA exerted noticeable protective and curative effects against MCT-induced PAH and pulmonary vascular remodeling through inhibiting cellular proliferation, oxidative stress, and inflammation.\nCollectively, these results suggest that hypoxia-induced DEC1 inhibits PPARγ, and that this is a predominant mechanism underpinning oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in PASMCs during PAH.\nNetwork pharmacology, transcriptomics, and biological results suggested that CANA could ameliorate PH by suppressing excessive oxidative stress and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation partially through the activation of PPARγ.\nIn this study, the inhibition of proteinase-activated receptor (PAR) 1/2 significantly reduced oxidative stress and fibrosis while suppressing the activation of MAPK or Smad pathways and the gene expression of molecules responsible for the pathways in the myocardium, consequently attenuating hypoxia-mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.\nWestern blot experiments showed that methyleugenol regulated the oxidative stress level in rats by activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, activate p27Kip1, inhibit CDK4/CCND1/ p-ERK1/2 and inhibited HIF-1α/RASSF1/Ras axis to inhibit cell proliferation, thereby improving the occurrence and development of high altitude pulmonary hypertension in rats.\nThe cardiac systolic function improved and mitochondrial structure of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells in rats with high altitude pulmonary hypertension was significantly improved after methyleugenol gavage intervention, and malondialdehyde levels in serum of rats were decreased while those of superoxide dismutase and glutathione increased, suggesting that the reduction of oxidative stress may be one of the mechanisms to improve mitochondrial function.\nmusclin treatment suppresses hypoxia-induced glycolysis, oxidative stress, proliferation, and migration.", "dois": ["10.3390/ijms26167702", "10.1002/jcp.70085", "10.1210/endocr/bqaf122", "10.1016/j.ejphar.2025.177938", "10.1016/j.redox.2025.103710", "10.1007/s11596-025-00074-8",

chemotherapy cycles, decreased radiation treatment breaks, and decreased rates of ostomy placement.\nLate toxicity is substantial after chemotherapy for anal cancer.\nMetastatic anal cancer is treated with chemotherapy aiming at prolonged survival.\nChemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immune-modulating therapies form the backbone of treatment of anal cancer in various stages.\nWe report a rare case of anal canal cancer with distant metastases who achieved R0 resection after modified FOLFOX6 chemotherapy.\nImmunosuppressed patients have poor tolerance of chemotherapy and response to chemoradiation, and an increased rate of recurrence.\nTobacco smoking status is associated with poor OS, LRFS, PFS and CFS in patients treated for anal cancer by high RT dose ± chemotherapy.\nConcurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy used in the treatment of anal cancer can have lasting effects on female sexual function and intimacy.\nInduction chemotherapy has the potential to become a standard approach in patients with bulky human papillomavirus-negative anal canal cancer.\nFor decades, chemoradiotherapy for early-stage disease and systemic chemotherapy for advanced disease have represented the mainstay of treatment for anal cancer.\nCapecitabine/mitomycin in combination with SIB RapidArc radiation therapy for anal cancer seems as effective as 5-FU-based chemotherapy and is well tolerated with minimal toxicity.\nWhen using a simultaneous integrated boost technique, a dose of 50.4 Gy to primary PTV and 42 Gy to lymph node PTV, both delivered over 28 fractions, with chemotherapy is appropriate for early stage anal cancer.\nSimultaneous integrated boost IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy as per RTOG 0529 protocol seems to be safe and feasible with consistent oncological outcomes and a mild acute and late toxicity profile in anal cancer patients.\nAlthough the overall response rate to immune checkpoint blockade therapies is low for metastatic anal cancer, high immune activation within the tumor and PD-L1", "dois": ["10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00605-9", "10.1007/s12328-025-02215-x", "10.1136/bmjopen-2025-109655", "10.1016/j.canrad.2025.104770",

activated the lipoxygenase activity of ALOX15B via inhibiting SLC7A11 to induce ferroptosis in bladder cancer cells, which provided insight into the molecular mechanism of the occurrence and development of bladder cancer.\nMechanistically, multiple rounds of sevoflurane exposure modulated lipid oxidation and lipogenesis in bladder cancer cells via the inhibition of Akt/mTOR/SREBP1 signaling, and reactivation of this signaling abrogated the influence of sevoflurane on ferroptosis and bladder cancer progression.\nIn bladder cancer cells, the compound tert-butylhydro-quinone

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "glycolysis", "key2": "bladder cancer", "summary": "Puerarin suppressed cell viability, migration, invasion, and glycolysis, and induced apoptosis in bladder cancer.\nMoreover, suppression of PI3K/AKT and HIF-1α attenuated Vitamin K2-increased glucose consumption and lactate generation, indicating that Vitamin K2 promotes PI3K/AKT and HIF-1α-mediated glycolysis in bladder cancer cells.\nHere, our study was the first to show that Vitamin K2 significantly promoted the glycolysis in bladder cancer cells by upregulating glucose consumption and lactate production, whereas inhibited TCA cycle by reducing the amounts of Acetyl-CoA.\nPFKs were critical genes in charge of glycolysis and were upregulated in bladder cancer.\nOverexpression of ALYREF promoted bladder cancer cell proliferation by PKM2-mediated glycolysis.\nIn summary, exerts strong inhibitory influences on bladder cancer cell proliferation and glycolysis via its destabilization of PDHK1.\nMechanistically, we illustrated that CASC8 reduced the glycolysis of bladder cancer cells via interacting with the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1).\nPuerarin impedes cell viability, migration, invasion, and glycolysis, and promoted apoptosis in bladder cancer by regulating circ_0020394/miR-328-3p/NRBP1 axis.\nSFN downregulates the unique glucose transport aberrant-independent aerobic glycolysis existed in bladder cancer via blocking the AKT1/HK2 axis and PDH expression.\nInvestigation of the underlying mechanism by which hampers glycolysis in bladder cancer cells revealed that it interacted with PDHK1 to inhibit its protein stabilization.\nThis suppresses the enzymatic activity of HK1, leading to an effective reduction of glycolysis, which triggers cell death via apoptosis in cells derived from human bladder cancer.\nMoreover, the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, hyper-activated in bladder cancer, acts as central regulator of aerobic glycolysis, hence contributing to cancer metabolic switch and tumor cell", "dois": ["10.1371/journal.pone.0332825", "10.1080/15384047.2025.2546219", "10.1002/iub.70028", "10.1038/s41419-025-07645-6",

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "chemotherapy", "key2": "Brain Tumor", "summary": "Furthermore, recent data reveal that COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction by downregulating respiratory complexes and mitochondrial biogenesis regulators such as TFAM and NRF2, ultimately leading to bioenergetic collapse and sensitization to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.\nP2X7R antagonists can inhibit its effect in glioma, while the expression of P2X7R can enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\nIn U87 cells, combined knockdown of these two genes significantly inhibits tumor growth and increases chemotherapy sensitivity, but knockdown of either gene alone does not.\nCo-treatment with etoposide and SAHA inhibits TFEB activity and enhances apoptotic cell death, representing a promising therapeutic strategy for treating malignant brain tumors.\nThese results highlight the potential of TMZ-loaded, PD-L1-targeted NLCs as a synergistic strategy to enhance GBM treatment by combining chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade.\nThe 3D-TTA model recapitulates clinical patterns of DIPG growth, evidenced by resistance to chemotherapy, HDAC and proteasome inhibitors, as well as sensitization to the antibody-activated innate immune microenvironment including complement proteins and surrounding microglia.\nKIF4A inhibits ferroptosis in GBM cells through the CHMP4B/GPX4 axis and promotes TMZ resistance.\nMel enhances TMZ's anti-tumour activity by inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation, suppressing NF-κB activation, and downregulating COX-2 expression.\nAdditionally, amlodipine enhanced the cytotoxicity of TMZ against GSCs by downregulating MGMT expression through the suppression of the Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin axis.\nInterestingly, Lut can induce ferroptosis by inhibiting Nrf2 expression, and also inhibit DNA repair through Wnt/β-catenin, promoting TMZ induced cell apoptosis.\nRecent studies have demonstrated that combining TMZ with natural compounds can enhance therapeutic efficacy through synergistic mechanisms and reduce systemic toxicity.", "dois": ["10.11477/mf.030126030530061192", "10.11477/mf.030126030530061176",

dividing stem cell population defined by upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos).\nHere, we show that heterozygous Kmt2d loss in murine cerebellar regions promotes MB genesis driven by heterozygous loss of the MB-suppressor gene Ptch via the upregulation of tumor-promoting programs (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation [OXPHOS]).\nThe accumulation of mitochondrial mass and the optimization of mitochondrial quality accounted for the increased oxidative phosphorylation, and interruption of the mitochondrial fusion process downregulated the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation and sensitized GBM cells to TMZ, which was also confirmed in the in vivo experiment.\nTherapeutically, targeting oxidative phosphorylation with gamitrinib in patient-derived organoids of LC-BrMs induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation.\nMetabolomic analysis suggested that oxidative phosphorylation was reduced within individual mitochondria, and that there was no reciprocal increase in glycolytic activity.\nLoss of TSPO resulted in a greater number of fragmented mitochondria, increased glucose uptake and lactic acid conversion, decreased oxidative phosphorylation, and increased glycolysis.\nAt the functional level, V-ATPase inhibition in GSC induces ROS production, mitochondrial damage, while hindering mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and reducing protein synthesis.\nThese APC-high states (mean difference = -0.43, adjusted < 0.001) also showed a shift in metabolic activity, with decreased oxidative phosphorylation and increased

ferroptosis induced by CENPF inhibition in cervical cancer cell lines is likely mediated through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.\nIn conclusion, these data inspired that METTL5-mediated mA modification of SLC7A11 promoted cervical cancer by inhibiting ferroptosis, providing a novel insight for cervical cancer.\nThis study confirmed that USP34 could upregulate PIN1 expression and SUMOylation, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis by suppressing the cGAS-STING pathway and in turn promoting the progression of cervical cancer.\nTherefore, our findings revealed that inhibiting ANXA6 can promote tumor cell ferroptosis by activating the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby provide potential strategies that enhancing the efficacy of anti-tumor immunotherapy in cervical cancer.\nThe decreased levels of p62 protein facilitated the degradation of Nrf2 by regulating the p62-Keap1-Nrf2 axis, thereby diminishing the antioxidant capacity of cervical cancer cells, ultimately leading to the induction of apoptosis and ferroptosis.\nMechanistically, CNIH4 elevated solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11)-mediated cystine import, and subsequently increased intracellular glutathione synthesis and glutathione peroxidase 4 activity, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis of human cervical cancer cells.\nFurther use of siRNA to interfere with ACSL4 expression in cervical cancer cells revealed that the inhibitory effect of OA on cell viability and proliferative capacity was counteracted, while a decrease in ROS levels and GPX4 was detected, suggesting that OA activated ferroptosis in Hela cells by promoting ACSL4 expression, thereby reducing the survival rate of Hela cells.\nDHODH inhibition inhibited the proliferation and promoted the ferroptosis in cervical cancer cells.\nPIN1 can increase the proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer cells by significantly inhibiting ferroptosis.\nCervical cancer is a prevalent form of cancer in women, and the", "dois": ["10.1016/j.yexcr.2025.114796",

a multitarget regulatory network involving MAPK signaling pathway-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation and migration, apoptosis activation, and cell cycle arrest.\nSS exhibited anti-cervical cancer effects, likely through the induction of ROS generation and inhibition of glucose metabolic reprogramming in cervical cancer cells, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis.\nIn vitro experiments revealed that Fu/CA NPs significantly inhibited the proliferation of cervical cancer HeLa cells (by 65.73 ± 4.06 %) and induced apoptosis through the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial damage.\nThe decreased levels of p62 protein facilitated the degradation of Nrf2 by regulating the p62-Keap1-Nrf2 axis, thereby diminishing the antioxidant

immune-suppressed brain tumors.\nMalignant astrocytomas are aggressive primary brain tumors characterized by extensive hypoxia-induced, mitochondria-dependent changes such as altered respiration, increased chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) proteasome activity, decreased apoptosis, drug resistance, stemness, and increased invasiveness.\nOf note, presence of FGL2 transforms low grade to high grade brain tumors via promoting Treg, macrophages, and perhaps stemness.\nG9a inhibition decreased PD-L1 and increased MHC-I expressions by inactivating Notch pathway companying stemness decrease in GSCs.\nMutual regulation between NF-κB and FOSL1 contributes to glioma tumorigenesis and stemness through promoting G1/S transition and inhibiting apoptosis.\nTherefore, inhibition of GGCT function may be useful in suppressing stemness of glioblastoma stem cells accompanied by activation of the hedgehog pathway.\nA search for the underlying mechanism of NAT10-mediated enhancement of GBM stemness led to identification of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-related genes as an epigenetic regulator.\nHere, we identify intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) as a key regulator of GSC stemness and tumorigenicity, promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment via β-catenin/PD-L1 signaling.\nFunctionally, LK-A impaired EMT-induced cell migration, invasion, and glioma stem cell-like traits, evidenced by decreased gliosphere formation and downregulation of stemness markers such as Sox2 and Oct4.\nThe increased antiproliferative effect of combining the two compounds resulted from a stronger downregulation of STAT3-mediated downstream GBM stemness regulators through dual PRMT1 and CaMKIIγ function blockade.\nSimilarly, blocking autophagy in stem cell-like GBM tumor subpopulations induced senescence-associated growth arrest without hampering stemness capacity or indu", "dois": ["10.1016/j.ejmech.2025.118255", "10.14715/cmb/2025.71.11.8", "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1372-25.2025",

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "proliferation", "key2": "Cervical Cancer", "summary": "Inhibition of STIM1-mediated SOCE can decrease proliferation and migration, and promoted the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells.\nSS exerted its anti-cervical cancer effects by inhibiting cell proliferation, promoting apoptosis, and inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.\nwhereas has-miR-449a, as an upstream regulatory miRNA of NOTCH1, could inhibit cervical cancer cell proliferation and enhance radiosensitivity by inhibiting NOTCH1 expression.\nZiyu I inhibits cervical cancer progression through a multitarget regulatory network involving MAPK signaling pathway-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation and migration, apoptosis activation, and cell cycle arrest.\nIn vitro experiments revealed that Fu/CA NPs significantly inhibited the proliferation of cervical cancer HeLa cells (by 65.73 ± 4.06 %) and induced apoptosis through the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial damage.\nAfter combining with EGFR, TNF-α and VEGFA, the active ingredient of Sculellaria Barbata can regulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and down-regulate the expression of MDM2 gene to inhibit the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which can inhibit cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration, and promote their apoptosis.\nPIN1 can increase the proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer cells by significantly inhibiting ferroptosis.\nElevating DLG2 levels significantly suppressed cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while promoting apoptosis.\nSIRT7 enhanced the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HeLa and SiHa cells, inhibited apoptosis, and promoted cervical cancer growth.\nSurprisingly, PGE inhibited CaSki cell proliferation, while it increased the proliferation of SiHa, HeLa, and C-33 A cervical cancer cells.\nChrysin selectively inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in every cervical cancer cell line assessed while exerting minimal effects on HaCaT cells.\nCellular experiments revealed that Ziyu I significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of cervical cancer", "dois":

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "apoptosis", "key2": "Cholangiocarcinoma", "summary": "Down-regulation of EZH2 inhibited the proliferation, colony and promoted apoptosis of cholangiocarcinoma cell.\nDegradation of AZGP1 suppresses apoptosis and facilitates cholangiocarcinoma tumorigenesis via TRIM25.\nSevoflurane induces apoptosis and inhibits the growth, migration, and invasion of cholangiocarcinoma cells by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.\nPDT promotes apoptosis and ferroptosis of cholangiocarcinoma cells by activating the P53/SLC7A11/GPX4 signaling pathway and inhibits the growth of cholangiocarcinoma.\npumila (UCTs) remarkably suppressed cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cell viability possibly via G2/M cell cycle arrest and activation of caspase-cascade to induce apoptosis.\nAs a tumor-suppressing miRNA, miR-29b is down-regulated in cholangiocarcinoma, and its overexpression can suppress the proliferation and induce apoptosis of cholangiocarcinoma cells.\nIn conclusion, our findings demonstrated that durvalumab and T-DXd synergistically promoted apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma cells by inhibiting EGR1 expression through inactivation of the p38 MAPK pathway.\nThe study is designed to explore the regulatory network that MALAT1 competitively binds with miR-188-5p to up-regulate PSMD10 to facilitate cholangiocarcinoma cell migration and invasion and suppress apoptosis.\nTo sum up, it was found that norcantharidin induced cholangiocarcinoma cell death, and autophagy suppression enhanced the pro-apoptotic action of norcantharidin, which appears to involve the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway activation and ROS generation.\nThese results indicated that UCTs exhibited the growth inhibition effect on TFK-1 cells possibly via G2/M cell cycle arrest and activation of caspase-cascade to induce apoptosis, and had potential as an anti-cholangiocarcinoma drug for further development.", "dois": ["10.3390/ijms262311718", "10.1016/j.bioorg.2025.109186",

cells by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.\nSTAT3 promotes migration and invasion of cholangiocarcinoma arising from choledochal cyst by transcriptionally inhibiting miR200c through the c-myb/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.\nOur results suggest that bufalin targeting CAMKK2 promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibits the proliferation and migration of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma through Wnt/β-catenin signal pathway.\nOur experiments demonstrated that APOC1 can induce G0/G1 phase arrest in cholangiocarcinoma cells by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby suppressing cell proliferation, migration and invasion.\nThe study is designed to explore the regulatory network that MALAT1 competitively binds with miR-188-5p to up-regulate PSMD10 to facilitate cholangiocarcinoma cell migration and invasion and suppress apoptosis.\nTRIM29 silencing mitigated the viability, proliferation, migration and sphere formation abilities of cholangiocarcinoma cells, increased E-cadherin expression and decreased the expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, CD33, Sox2 and Nanog proteins in cholangiocarcinoma cells.\nIn addition, sevoflurane induced cholangiocarcinoma cell apoptosis, inhibited cholangiocarcinoma cell migration and invasion, as well as the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway evidenced by decreased Wnt3a, β-catenin, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1 protein and mRNA expression, reduced p-GSK3β protein expression and p-GSK3β/GSK3β ratio.\nCanagliflozin inhibits cholangiocarcinoma cell growth and migration and its anti-tumor effect is enhanced when combined with an NAMPT inhibitor.\nFurthermore, modulation of EIF3B expression, either depletion or elevation, demonstrated the ability to inhibit or enhance cholangiocarcinoma", "dois": ["10.3390/ijms262311718",

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "proliferation", "key2": "colorectal cancer(CRC)", "summary": "These mutations activate pathways that drive cell proliferation, impair differentiation, and suppress apoptosis.\nINHBB was upregulated in CRC, and the alleviation of INHBB suppressed the proliferation and migration of CRC cells.\nBaicalein inhibits proliferation, suppresses metastasis, induces apoptosis, and modulates key pathways like PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and TLR4/NF-κB.\nFurthermore, cell phenotype assays demonstrated that enhances proliferation and migration, suppresses apoptosis, and engages in the signaling pathway.\nIn CRC cells, lentivirus-mediated 5-HT7 overexpression enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion, whereas RNA interference-mediated knockdown suppressed these processes.\nMechanistically, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation drives senescence and autophagy inhibition, which inactivates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, thereby inhibiting CRC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration.\nKnockdown of PIN1 in MSS CRC cells significantly reduced cell proliferation (assessed by CCK-8 assay), impaired migratory capacity (assessed via wound-healing assay), and increased the apoptotic rate (detected by flow cytometry).\nOur study revealed that CACNA2D3, which is expressed at low levels in CRC, inhibits CRC cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis by up-regulating intracellular Ca and ROS levels and activating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.\nPINK1 acts as a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer by inhibiting proliferation and migration, promoting apoptosis, and remodeling the epigenetic landscape through altering histone modifications and enhancing chromatin accessibility.\nIn conclusion, Frondanol inhibits CRC cell proliferation and induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway in vitro, suggesting that it is a potential nutraceutical for the prevention of human colorectal cancer or a valuable source of anticancer compounds.\nWe identified 226 differentially expressed genes from TCGA-CRC cohort, among which the upregulated genes were mainly involved in pathways of cancer progression, proliferation, migration,", "dois": ["10.1007/s12672-025-04081-y", "10.1186/s43556-025-00361-9", "10.1128/spectrum.00788-25", "10.1021/acsomega.5c07683", "10.3389/fonc.2025.1583277", "10.3389/fgeed.2025.1679698",

chemotherapy and PD-1 inhibitor as first-line therapy exhibited prolonged OS and PFS, and increased PR and ORR over those receiving chemotherapy alone, with an acceptable toxicity profile.", "dois":

mediated PD-L1 based exosomal inhibition revitalized T cells and enhanced the ferroptosis.\nMoreover, upregulated interferon-γ efficiently inhibits system x activity and sensitizes cancer cells to Ferroptosis.\nBy suppressing the expression of target gene DKK1, miR-130b-3p activated the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, whereby repressing ferroptosis.\nThen we proved that CAMKK2 negatively regulated ferroptosis through the activation of NRF2 and the suppression of lipid peroxidation.\nWe found that inhibition of DCPS by shRNA or RG3039 induced gene transcript alteration and ferroptosis through reducing the mRNA turnover of GLRX.\nIn conclusion, ELK4 enhances proliferation, invasion, and migration while inhibiting ferroptosis in SKCM cells by upregulating CHMP6 transcription.\nWe also show that Arg2 suppresses ferroptosis by activating the Akt/GPX4 signaling pathway, negatively regulating sorafenib-induced cell death in melanoma cells.\nIn vivo experiments confirmed that vemurafenib treatment enhanced PSMB9 expression, increased iron ion accumulation, and suppressed tumor growth via ferroptosis induction.\nThus, T cell-promoted tumour ferroptosis is an anti-tumour mechanism, and targeting this pathway in combination with checkpoint blockade is a potential therapeutic approach.\nAt the same time, the expression of ATF3 protein increased and the expression of NRF2 protein decreased, suggesting that metformin may induce ferroptosis through the ATF3/NRF2 axis.\nFerroptosis, driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO), enhances immunogenicity through damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release and depletion of immunosuppressive cells.\nMeanwhile lipid peroxidation is a hallmark of ferroptosis, and we confirm that MEN1 promotes ferroptosis

in pancreatic cancer (PC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) are yet to be investigated integrally.\nAdditionally, targeting the oxidative stress pathway may serve as a new strategy in clinical practice to enhance SKCM chemotherapy and sensitivity.\nMitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress-mediated inflammasome activation play critical roles in the pathogenesis of the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\nMoreover, NAG-1/GDF15 overexpression inhibited HFD- and FFA-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage which in turn reduced double-strand DNA (dsDNA) release into the cytosol, while NAG-1/GDF15 siRNA showed opposite effects.\nIn conclusion, our results provide evidence that other than regulating lipid homeostasis, NAG-1/GDF15 protects against hepatic steatosis through a novel mechanism via suppressing oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, dsDNA release, and AIM2 inflammasome activation.\nThe reduced ROS production and dsDNA release may be responsible for attenuated AIM2 activation by NAG-1/GDF15 upon fatty acid overload.\nThis study demonstrated that NTP exposure for 5 min results in the differential regulation of miRNAs related to the PI3K-AKT-ZEB1 axis and cell cycle dysregulation to facilitate melanoma suppression.\nWe conclude that the oxidative stress in the bloodstream decreases during the metastatic process and that nitrosative stress increases during the proliferation and growth of metastatic nodules in the tumor microenvironment.\nAn increase in blood plasma lipid peroxidation occurred at the earliest stage of the disease, with a progressive decrease in oxidative damage and an increase in antioxidant defense.\nVice versa, increased lipid peroxidation and 3-nitrotyrosine, and decreased antioxidant parameters were observed in the metastatic nodules throughout the disease.\nOxidative stress is known to be a major barrier for metastatic colonization, such that metastasizing cancer cells must rewire their metabolic pathways", "dois": ["10.1371/journal.pone.0336451", "10.31557/APJCP.2025.26.10.3671", "10.1038/s41598-025-21315-9", "10.1002/mc.70040", "10.1007/s12010-025-05346-6",

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "chemotherapy", "key2": "pancreatic cancer(PC)", "summary": "Mechanistically, STAMBP promoted the PDK1-mediated Warburg effect and chemotherapy resistance by modulating E2F1 via direct binding to E2F1 and suppressing its degradation and ubiquitination.\nThese findings reveal the mechanisms underlying the development of GEM chemotherapy resistance based on ferroptosis and suggest that the combined use of BUB1 inhibitors may be an effective approach to enhance GEM efficacy.\nClinically, ginsenoside Rg3 (RG3) is typically combined with chemotherapy to enhance antitumor effects and reduce side effects.\nIn addition, we found that knockdown of B3GNT5 in PC cells inhibited cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis, as well as stemness of cancer stem cells and enhanced chemotherapy sensitivity to gemcitabine.\nTogether, our data demonstrate that CXCR2-driven neutrophil recruitment increases with PC progression, is enhanced by gemcitabine chemotherapy, promotes an immunosuppressive microenvironment, and is associated with poor patient survival.\nIL-1β blockade not only prevented myocarditis and reduced cardiac fibrosis but also enhanced the antitumor efficacy of the combination of chemotherapy plus dual ICB therapy and significantly improved the overall survival of PDAC-bearing obese mice.\nIn summary, TRIM21 promotes tumour growth and gemcitabine resistance in PC by inhibiting EPHX1-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism.\nIn this study, downregulation of BUB1 enhanced the sensitivity of PC cells to Erastin, and inhibited cell proliferation and migration.\nmiR-1305 overexpression prominently inhibited PC cell proliferation and metastasis promoted cell apoptosis in vitro, and alleviated PC formation in vivo.\nMeanwhile, the knockdown of AHNAK2 expression enhanced cell-ECM adhesion, inhibited cell-cell adhesion, and downregulated the KRAS/p53 signaling pathway in PC.\nThrough tests conducted in both live organisms and laboratory settings, it has been determined that capsaicin has the ability to inhibit tumor growth and induce apoptosis in cancer cells.", "dois": ["10.1016/j.ejso.2025.111311",

the potential role of the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with advanced penile cancer.\nEarly ILND followed by adjuvant chemotherapy for penile cancer with palpable lymph nodes is more favourable than neoadjuvant TIP chemotherapy.\nFrequently used combination chemotherapy with 5 fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (CDDP) in patients with metastatic penile cancer mostly results in the development of acquired drug resistance.\nOverall, the TP regimen stands out as the most effective and well-tolerated chemotherapy regimen for penile cancer, demonstrating both superior

the effect of shMEG3 on proliferation, invasion, migration, apoptosis and the EMT process in pituitary tumor cells.\nBromocriptine (Bc) produces pituitary tumoral mass regression which induces the cellular death that was classically described as apoptosis.\nTransfection of somatolactotrope GH3 cells with pUC-shHNr increased apoptosis, suggesting that endogenous HNr plays a cytoprotective role

pharmacological inhibition of VDAC reduced extracellular mtDNA levels, reversed PMN-MDSC-driven immunosuppression, and enhanced chemotherapy efficacy in prostate cancer mouse models.\nThis study investigates the structural inhibition potential of identified bioactive compounds of Carissa carandas against GGT, which could increase drug efficacy and hence increase the therapeutic ability of chemotherapy for prostate cancer.\nSupported by preclinical models, we hypothesized that the PARP inhibitor talazoparib in combination with temozolomide chemotherapy could induce DNA damage leading to cell death and tumor response in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) without HRR alterations.\nThis work offered a new strategy to enhance the treatment efficacy of prostate cancer (PCa) through ferroptosis-chemotherapy-sonodynamic synergistic therapy.\nProstate cancer in TET3 high expression group was more sensitive to ADT drugs such as Bicalutamide and AZD3514, and was also more sensitive to chemotherapy drugs such as Cyclophosphamide, Paclitaxel, and Vincristine, and MAPK pathway inhibitors of Docetaxel and Dabrafenib.\nAcquired drug resistance and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment significantly limit the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in advanced prostate cancer.\nAlterations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes occur in 20%-30% of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) which may increase sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy.\nThus, our findings reveal a critical role of de novo lipogenesis in protecting cancer cells from chemotherapeutics and suggest that treatment with lipogenesis inhibitors could improve the efficacy of chemotherapy against human prostate cancer.\nPATIENT

inhibiting their growth via oxidative stress compared uncoated ZnO NFs.\nIn non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) cells, AEA reduced the total intracellular level of glutathione and induced oxidative stress.\nSimultaneously, excessive solar UVB exposure increases the risk of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers through mechanisms involving DNA damage and oxidative stress.\nUVR promotes skin cancer through multiple mechanisms, including induction of inflammation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage such as 8-oxoguanine and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers.\nIn a panel of cultured human squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma skin cancer cells (SCC-25, HaCaT-ras II-4, A375, G361, LOX), photodynamic induction of cell death was elicited by the combined action of solar simulated UVA (6.6 J cm ) and FICZ (≥10 nm), preceded by the induction of oxidative stress as substantiated by MitoSOX Red fluorescence microscopy, comet detection of Fpg-sensitive oxidative genomic lesions and upregulated stress response gene expression (HMOX1, HSPA1A, HSPA6).\nHowever, little is known regarding the effects and mechanism of glutathione reductase (GR) inhibition-induced oxidative stress in regulation of melanoma metastasis.\nLike other ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors, induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and genes associated with oxidative stress, including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2).\nThe results showed that red united blue light irradiation efficaciously synergized with Cur to trigger oxidative stress-mediated cell death, induce apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation.\nIn conclusion, these findings demonstrate that acemannan may be a promising therapeutic agent for skin cancer prevention due to its ability to regulate oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis.\nAMPK pathway inhibition caused apoptosis of c-Myc-expressing melanoma cells, while AMPK activation protected against cell death", "dois": ["10.1016/j.fitote.2025.106956",

cells leads to robust upregulation of ferroptosis suppressor protein-1 (FSP1).\nHere, we report that the ShcD phosphotyrosine adaptor protein is upregulated in TNBC, and its expression correlates with overall reduced patient survival and decreased response to chemotherapy.\nThrough in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrated that silencing of KPNA2 enhances TNBC sensitivity to chemotherapy by promoting multipolar division and suppressing homologous recombination repair (HR), a critical DNA damage repair mechanism.\nBlockade of the programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) enhances the efficacy of standard chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of triple-negative early breast cancer (TNBC) but is associated with adverse events.\nIn conjunction with chemotherapy, this strategy enhanced the immunological effect of a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor by re-invigorating cytotoxic T lymphocytes and promoting the reacquisition of memory T-cell responses.\nIn conjunction with chemotherapy, this strategy can synergistically leverage the immunomodulatory properties of chemotherapeutic drugs to increase immunogenic cell death, mitigate immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment, and slow the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).\nThe platelet-sparing proteolysis-targeted chimera (PROTAC) BCL-XL degrader DT2216 enhanced the efficacy of doxorubicin against TNBC xenografts in vivo without induction of thrombocytopenia that is often observed with the first-generation BCL-XL inhibitors, supporting the development of this combinatorial

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "apoptosis", "key2": "triple-negative breast cancer(TNBC)", "summary": "We found that EM2 induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells by inhibiting AKT and HR pathways.\nB8 effectively reduced cell viability, induced apoptosis, and caused G2/M cell cycle arrest in TNBC cells.\nCollectively, pirfenidone arrests the cell cycle and promotes apoptosis of TNBC cells by suppressing Hedgehog/GLI1 signaling.\nLoaded with gambogenic acid (GNA), OPDMA-PCL-GNA induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.\nSRPX2 knockdown inhibited TNBC cell viability, invasion, and Stemness of tumor while promoting TNBC cell apoptosis and ferroptosis.\nFlow cytometry confirmed increased apoptosis, evidenced by upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes and suppression of anti-apoptotic genes.\nIn vivo, GDP-uPA/GTI significantly downregulated R2 expression and activated caspase 8 and caspase 3, indicating caspase-dependent apoptosis.\nEukaryotic Elongation Factor 2 Kinase (eEF2K) is overexpressed in TNBC, promoting cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis through phosphorylation of eEF2.\nIn vitro, KEAF inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation and migration, modulated the cell cycle, and induced apoptosis by downregulating PI3K/Akt signaling.\nIn conclusion, PD effectively inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis in TNBC cells through the activation of ROS and endoplasmic reticulum stress.\nIn vivo, DMA (25 mg/kg) suppressed MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor growth by approximately 78% ( < 0.01) and induced apoptosis through regulating AKT/Hh/Gli1 axis.\nFurthermore, in primary tumors formed by TIE1-expressing cells, we observed TIE1 cleavage, reduced apoptosis, and activation of the AK", "dois":

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "migration", "key2": "ureteral obstruction", "summary": "Tubulointerstitial fibrosis, which involves macrophage-promoted extracellular matrix production and myofibroblast migration, can be induced in rats by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO).\nIn vivo, both global or myeloid cell specific HCK-KO attenuates renal inflammation and fibrosis with reduces macrophage numbers, pro-inflammatory polarization and migration into unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) kidneys and unilateral ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) models.\nMoreover, PCA reduced TGF-β1-induced migration in the wound-healing assay.\nTo conclude, i-body AD-214 attenuates UUO-induced kidney fibrosis by inhibiting leukocyte infiltration and macrophage migration.\nColchicine was demonstrated to inhibit angiotensin II‑induced fibroblast migration in vitro in a concentration‑dependent manner.\nOur findings reveal that ISO can enhance cell morphology and effectively inhibit the migration ability of TGF-β-induced HK-2 cells.\nMoreover, PKNOX2 knockdown decreased TGF-β1-induced migration of myofibroblasts and differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts.\nFurthermore, miR-490-3p was decreased in UUO mice and negatively correlated with increased expression of high migration protein A2 (HMGA2).\nMechanistically, angiopoietin-1 reduced CCL2-activated macrophage migration and protected endothelial cells against cell apoptosis induced by angiopoietin-2 and Wnt ligands.\nUsing a myeloid cell-specific Atg5 knockout (MΦ atg5) mouse, we established renal ischemia/reperfusion and unilateral ureteral obstruction models to evaluate the role of macrophage Atg5 in renal macrophage migration and fibrosis.\nIn mice with progressive kidney disease induced by either ureteral obstruction or ischemia-reperfusion injury, overexpression of human angiopoietin-1 in the kidney tubules not only reduced macrophage", "dois": ["10.33594/000000833",

and folic acid-treated mouse models and inhibited the proliferation and activation of renal fibroblasts in vitro.\nDuring ureteral obstruction, treatment with BAY PP1 significantly reduced tubulointerstitial fibrosis, proliferation of interstitial fibroblasts, and TGF-β(1) expression.\nCompared to sham-operated mice, the number of LYVE-1-positive lymphatic vessels, the proliferation of LYVE-1-positive lymphatic endothelial cells, along with VEGF-C and -D mRNA expression were all significantly increased following ureteral obstruction.\nJPH203, a specific inhibitor of SLC7A5, effectively reversed the above phenomena, inhibited mTORC1 signaling activation, and reduced the proliferation of fibroblasts.\nSimilarly, TGF-β1-mediated overactivation of the proliferation-related signalling in TECs induced EMT, and the myofibroblastic phenotype was suppressed by resveratrol.\nFluorofenidone (125 mg/kg.d) could attenuate renal interstitial fibrosis through inhibition of fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblastic activation, PDGF and CTGF expression.\nThus, HSP72 blocks fibroblast activation and proliferation in renal fibrosis via targeting the STAT3 pathway and may serve as a novel therapeutic agent for chronic kidney disease regardless of the etiology.\nMechanistically, narciclasine reversed the failed-repair phenotype of tubular epithelial cells and inhibited fibroblasts proliferation and activation, at least partially via inhibiting the activation of NF-κB signaling.\nOur results suggest a role for the MAPK-ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt systems in early changes induced by ureteral obstruction and that inhibition of these signaling pathways may provide a novel approach to prevent progression of renal fibrosis.\nSrc inhibition also suppressed activation of

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "stemness", "key2": "bladder cancer", "summary": "Overall, this study reveals a novel mechanism for silibinin targeting bladder cancer metastasis, in which inactivation of β-catenin/ZEB1 signaling by silibinin leads to dual-block of EMT and stemness.\nThese findings indicate that KDM6A deficiency promotes cancer stemness and confers resistance to ALA-PDT in bladder cancer cells by suppressing ROS generation despite increased PpIX levels.\nAfter knockdown of HOXA-AS2 in bladder cancer 5637 and T24 cells, the migration, invasion and stemness of cancer cells were significantly inhibited, indicating the capability of HOXA-AS2 to promote the migration, invasion and stemness of bladder cancer cells.\nWe further found that depletion of ASAP1-IT1 in T24 cells by RNA interference reduced the stemness of bladder cancer, whereas forced overexpression of ASAP1-IT1 in J82 cells enhanced cancer cell stemness by sphere assay, ALDEFLUOR and flow cytometry assay on CD44+ population.\nSHOX2 promotes the migration, invasion and stemness of human bladder cancer cells possibly by regulating EMT via the TGF-β signaling pathway.\nMYBL2 CSCs derived CCL15, which bound to CCR1 and induced SPP1 upregulation in macrophages which reciprocally enhanced bladder cancer stemness and resistance to nICB through the SPP1-ITGα9β1 axis.\nThis study reveals that TET3 promotes tumor growth and progression in bladder cancer partly through modulation of the stemness pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker.\nLncRNA XIST may act as an inhibitor of miR-200c to regulate the stemness properties and tumourigenicity of bladder cancer cells, and our findings might reveal a potential strategy of targeting XIST for bladder cancer therapy.\nTaken together, these results indicate that knockdown of cyclin D1b suppresses the malignant phenotypes of human bladder cancer cells via induction of apoptosis and suppression of cancer cell stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.\nDifferentiation and elimination therapies targeting EMT-", "dois": ["10.3892/or.2025.9006", "10.1038/s41419-025-08222-7",

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "migration", "key2": "bladder cancer", "summary": "COL6A1 downregulation inhibited bladder cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and induced cell apoptosis.\nInterestingly, downregulation of SVIL by SVIL-specifc small hairpin RNAs significantly reduced the promoting effect of CRH on bladder cancer cell migration.\nHigh expression of miR-204-5p promotes proliferation, migration and invasion and reduces apoptosis of bladder cancer cells by negatively regulating RAB22A expression.\nBoth CAPE-induced GDF15 expression and the supernatant from bladder cancer cells with overexpressing GDF15 impeded the HBdSF and HBdSMC migration, suggesting that CAPE-upregulated GDF15 blocked the cell migration.\nIncreased CELF2 expression suppressed the proliferation and migration of bladder cancer cells.\nSRT1720 treatment also suppressed bladder cancer cells migration, invasion and induced apoptosis.\nRo-31-8220 treatment suppressed bladder cancer cell migration and invasion and also induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner.\nIn bladder cancer cells, miR-204-5p overexpression significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion and reduced cell apoptosis.\nMoreover, PLACS NPs simultaneously activated the expression of four target genes, inhibiting proliferation and migration, and promoting apoptosis in bladder cancer cells.\nRB1 mutations and the 4-aminobiphenyl interference could significantly decrease the RB1 expression level and thus promote the proliferation, invasion, and migration ability of bladder cancer cells.\nOverexpression of CK17 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of bladder cancer cells 5637, and silencing of CK17 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of bladder cancer cells T24.\nSubsequently, CCK8, clone formation assay and Transwell result showed Curdione enhances GEM inhibition of bladder cancer cell activity, clonal formation and migration, these combine therapeutic schedule also could inhibited growth of in vivo xenograft tumors.\nFunctional experiments revealed that hypoxia-induced bladder cancer cell migration

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "proliferation", "key2": "bladder cancer", "summary": "COL6A1 downregulation inhibited bladder cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and migration and induced cell apoptosis.\nCircFAM64A(3) promoted bladder cancer proliferation and inhibited CD8 + T cell via sponging to miR-149-5p and activated IL-6/JAK/STAT pathway.\nHPP induced bladder cancer cell autophagy by regulating macrophages in the co-culture system, resulting in the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation.\nE2F8 knockdown suppressed bladder cancer cell proliferation, accompanied by the performance of G1 phase arrest and the upregulated Cyclin D1 protein expression.\nHigh expression of miR-204-5p promotes proliferation, migration and invasion and reduces apoptosis of bladder cancer cells by negatively regulating RAB22A expression.\nRescue experiments showed that knockdown reversed the inhibitory effect of knockdown on cell proliferation, upregulated PCNA, MCM2, and Cyclin D1 (all <0.05), and promoted bladder cancer cell proliferation (<0.001).\nYTHDF2 was upregulated in bladder cancer cell lines, and its knockdown suppressed cell viability (<0.001), downregulated PCNA, MCM2, and CyclinD1 (all <0.05), reduced colony numbers 3-fold (<0.01), and inhibited proliferation.\nOverall, this study suggests that bladder tumors can increase PD-L1 expression to promote PD-L1-mediated intrinsic tumor growth pathways, and metformin effectively downregulates PD-L1 expression, suppresses bladder cancer cell proliferation, and prolongs survival in an orthotopic bladder cancer mouse model.\nIn vitro, SQ-diEG inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in bladder cancer cell lines.\nIncreased CELF2 expression suppressed the proliferation and migration of bladder cancer cells.\nBrazilin significantly inhibited bladder cancer cell proliferation and induced apoptosis and DNA damage in vitro.\nIn bladder cancer cells, miR-204-5p overexpression significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion and reduced cell apopt", "dois": ["10.1016/j.jep.2025.120890", "10.1016/j.cyto.2025.157084", "10.1016/j.prp.2025.156287",

which is a positive pathway in BC progression and contributes to the maintenance of cancer cell stemness.\nThis upregulation correlated with poor patient prognosis, cancer stemness, and metabolic reprogramming, which was driven by genetic alterations such as gene amplification and reduced promoter methylation.\nMechanistically, TIM3 increases β-catenin/interleukin-1β (IL-1β) signaling, leading to stemness and immune-evasion by inducing immunosuppressive γδ T cells and reducing CD8 T cells during micrometastasis.\nBy inhibiting anti-immune effects and promoting non-immune mechanisms such as tumor cell stemness, epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and angiogenesis, MDSCs effectively promote tumor growth and metastasis.\nIn this sense, the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine and an upstream regulator of the immune response, enhances breast tumorigenesis through escalating cancer cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, and stemness, which then brings tumorigenic effects by activating key oncogenic signaling pathways and inducing immunosuppression.\nMoreover, miR-155 induced stemness and DCA resistance by inhibiting the direct target gene tetraspanin-5 (TSPAN5).\nFurthermore, miR-143-5p reduces cell proliferation, cell cycle entry, and stemness, while promoting apoptosis

advanced and metastatic gastric cancer (GC) patients.\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy improves the resection rate and reduces postoperative recurrence in gastric cancer (GC) but is often associated with significant toxicity.\nProgrammed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors combined with chemotherapy have become a standard treatment for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced gastric cancer (GC).\nPiper longum significantly suppressed gastric cancer (GC) growth in a dose-dependent manner, with high-dose treatment demonstrating superior efficacy compared to conventional chemotherapy (L-OHP + 5-FU).\nGastric cancer (GC) frequently shows malignant progression and resistance to chemotherapy due to complex molecular regulatory processes, leading to a poor prognosis.\n5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a first-line chemotherapy for gastric cancer (GC), but its efficacy is often limited by acquired resistance mediated by upregulation of thymidylate synthase (TS).\nBy promoting TME acidification, immunosuppression, and epigenetic reprogramming, lactate emerges as a pivotal regulator in reshaping GC immune evasion and therapeutic resistance, while also strongly correlating with chemotherapy resistance.\nConversely, MTA1 knockdown sensitized cells to chemotherapy, promoted apoptosis, and reduced stem-like properties.\nChemotherapy alone exhibits suboptimal efficacy in patients with treatment-naïve advanced gastric cancer (GC).\nNivolumab plus chemotherapy has shown efficacy in clinical trials for advanced or recurrent gastric cancer (GC).\nChidamide enhances the sensitivity of gastric cancer to 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy by suppressing the HDAC3/HNF4A/TYMS axis.\nTumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in progression and low responsiveness to chemotherapy of gastric cancer (GC).\nChemotherapy remains the cornerstone of gastric cancer (GC) treatment, with Oxaliplatin (OXA) being", "dois": ["10.1002/deo2.70189",

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "glycolysis", "key2": "Gastric cancer (GC)", "summary": "Previously, we reported that Pumilio 1 (PUM1), a RBP, could regulate glycolysis metabolism and promote the progression of gastric cancer (GC).\nOur previous studies have found that TOP1MT is a crucial gene that inhibits glycolysis and cell metastasis of gastric cancer (GC) cells, but the mechanism of its regulation of glycolysis remains unclear.\nGlycolysis is activated in various cancers, including gastric cancer (GC).\nHowever, the role of ISL1 in stimulating glycolysis to promote tumorigenesis in gastric cancer (GC) is unclear.\nHere, it is revealed that N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C), a newly identified mRNA modification, enhances hypoxia tolerance in gastric cancer (GC) cells by promoting glycolysis addiction.\nHere, we show that gastric cancer (GC) cells with high metastatic potential strongly promote the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis in fibroblasts.\nBesides, we demonstrate that the inhibition of miR-5683 promotes glycolysis by upregulating the PDK4 expression, thus leading to GC progression.\nWhen upregulated, we also determined that miR-7 was able to inhibit the proliferation, colony formation, and glycolysis of GC cells owing to its regulation of LDH-A.\nUnder the glucose deprivation condition, knockdown of PGM1 significantly suppressed cell viability, proliferation and glycolysis, whereas lipid metabolism was enhanced.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that knockdown of MDFI inhibited the increase in GC cell proliferation and glycolysis by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.\nMechanistically, enhances the glycolysis pathway and facilitates PD-L1 lactylation through the PI3K/AKT/HIF1α signaling pathway, thereby suppressing anti-tumor immunity in CD8 T cells.\nIn our previous study, we demonstrated that fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase-2 (FBP2), an enzyme that suppresses cell glycolysis and growth, is downregulated in GC due to promot", "dois": ["10.1016/j.cellsig.2025.112234", "10.1111/1440-1681.70096", "10.1016/j.intimp.2025.115630", "10.1038/s41392-025-02451-0",

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "oxidative phosphorylation", "key2": "Germ Cell Tumor", "summary": "Inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in activated T cells was sufficient to suppress proliferation and upregulate genes linked to T cell exhaustion.\nHere, we show that heterozygous Kmt2d loss in murine cerebellar regions promotes MB genesis driven by heterozygous loss of the MB-suppressor gene Ptch via the upregulation of tumor-promoting programs (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation [OXPHOS]).\nThe transcriptional activation of KLF12 facilitates the activation of critical pro-cancer pathways such as inflammation and NF-κB, while inhibiting the tumor-suppressive mechanisms of P53 and oxidative phosphorylation.\nBy contrast, TFAM loss in mitochondrial (MTC)-type A172 cells caused minimal phenotypic alterations, associated with elevated expression and activation of antioxidant, mitochondrial membrane, and survival pathways, alongside suppression of oxidative phosphorylation and vesicle-trafficking genes.\nHere, engineering PEGylated epigallocatechin gallate nanoparticles (PE-NPs) in injectable hyaluronan gels upregulated oxidative phosphorylation by activating mitochondrial complex I of B16F10 cells, which greatly increased NAD level, a NADH oxidation product catalyzed by complex I, to inhibit hypoxia-inducible factor-1 expression.\nIt was shown that coordinated upregulation of autophagy followed by its inhibition prior to chemotherapy decreased electron transfer system (ETS) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity, impaired mitochondrial fission and fusion dynamics and enhanced apoptotic cell death onset in terms of cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP expression.\nF3-T3 activates oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis and induces sensitivity to inhibitors of oxidative metabolism.\nThe latter, mitochondrial-type GSCs increased lactate production after treatment with the oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor oligomycin or phenformin.\nDCA reverses the Warburg effect by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases, which subsequently activates mitochondrial oxi", "dois":

Lung Cancer (LC), Breast Cancer (BC), Bladder Cancer (BlC), and Gastric Cancer (GC), where it has been shown to promote cancer proliferation, migration, and therapy resistance, correlating significantly with advanced cancer stages and poor prognosis.\nKnockdown inhibited cell viability, migration, and invasion and promoted apoptosis.\nIn vivo, circMORC1 promoted proliferation, viability, and migration and inhibited apoptosis in AGS and SGC-7901 GC cell lines.\nTransfection with the mimic reduced cell viability, increased apoptosis, and inhibited migration, as shown by wound-healing assays.\nHSPB1 overexpression enhanced proliferation, invasion, and migration while suppressing apoptosis by downregulating PANoptosis markers.\nOverexpression of SNHG5 or knockdown of miR-92a-3p reduced GC cell proliferation and migration, and increased BTG2 expression while decreasing PI3K/AKT signaling activity.\nUpregulation of CAB39L inhibited GC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, decreased the expression of PFKP and LDHA, and increased both apoptosis and AMPK activation.\nGPR176 was found to be upregulated in GC, and functional assays demonstrated that its knockdown suppressed proliferation and migration in the GC cell lines SGC-7901 and HGC-27.\nWe demonstrate that BAG2 upregulation inhibited apoptosis and increased proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells, whereas the opposite results were obtained in BAG2-deficient GC cells.\nRBPMS2 promoted the proliferation, invasion, and migration of GC cells while inhibiting pyroptosis by suppressing the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)/caspase - 1/gasdermin (DGSDMD) signaling pathway.\nThe high expression of GPX4 in GC inhibits EBV's immediate early lytic gene BZLF",

morbidity.\nMultidisciplinary treatment plans are necessary, including surgical resection for benign tumors, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy for malignant tumors, and novel targeted therapies such as MDM2 inhibitors for selected cases.\nThe presence of cardiac masses adds further complexity to the management of lymphoma patients beyond myocardial chemotherapy-related toxicity, given possible unpredictable acute complications such as arrhythmias, atrioventricular block, myocardial ischemia, pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade.\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)-associated

reduction of immunosuppression, conversion to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, chemotherapy, or a combination of these.\nThe patient was clinically diagnosed with Kaposi sarcoma and started on chemotherapy with bleomycin, vincristine, and doxorubicin.\nCurative treatment of aggressive Kaposi sarcoma (KS) with conventional chemotherapy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients remains difficult.\nPrimary effusion lymphoma (PEL) caused by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis even under chemotherapy.\nMultiple treatment modalities for Kaposi sarcoma (KS) have been reported, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgical excision, electrochemotherapy, and cryotherapy.\nThe recommended first-line chemotherapy agents for managing Kaposi sarcoma (KS) in high-income countries are expensive and often unavailable in developing nations such as Peru.\nConsequently, LANA-FBW7 interaction enhances the stability of MCL-1 by preventing its proteasome-mediated degradation, which inhibits caspase-3-mediated apoptosis in PEL cells.\nThese compounds induce significant PEL apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and intracellular ceramide production through regulation of ceramide synthesizing or ceramide metabolizing enzymes and dramatically suppress tumor progression without visible toxicity in vivo.\nThe combination of chemotherapy and electroporation enhances drug uptake into tumoral cells.\nPatients treated with chemotherapy or mTOR inhibitor conversion were more likely to have visceral KS.\nHe was successfully treated with chemotherapy and reduction of immunosuppression and switch over to rapamycin.\nWe started anti-HIV therapy and chemotherapy against these lesions, and the lesions subsequently reduced in size.\nElectrochemotherapy performed with reduced bleomycin dosages could be as effective as with currently recommended dose.\nAlthough KS can be managed with the reduction of immunosuppression, visceral forms may require chemotherapy an", "dois": ["10.1186/s12879-025-11948-6", "10.1016/j.anplas.2025.05.013", "10.1177/01455613221111734",

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "proliferation", "key2": "Kaposi Sarcoma", "summary": "We show that the absence of miRNAs likewise can be used to determine tumor origin (miR-155) and proliferation state because tumor suppressor miRNAs (miR-222/221, let-7 family) were significantly down-regulated in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and in Kaposi sarcoma (KS), an endothelial cell tumor.\nWe have previously shown that 1α,25(OH)2-Vitamin D3 [1α,25(OH)2D3] and its less calcemic analog TX 527 inhibit the proliferation of endothelial cells transformed by the viral G protein-coupled receptor associated to Kaposi sarcoma (vGPCR) and this could be partially explained by the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway.\nThe animal had multiple oral tumors characterized by proliferation of latent nuclear antigen 1-positive spindle cells and was not co-infected with immunosuppressive simian viruses, suggesting that it had Kaposi sarcoma caused by this novel rhadinovirus.\nDSF suppresses PEL cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis through the activation of innate antiviral immunity.\nRapamycin inhibited KHE primary cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and autophagy, and blocked the mTOR signaling pathway.\nAltogether, these results suggest that 1α,25(OH)2D3 and TX 527 inhibit the proliferation of SVEC and SVEC-vGPCR and induce apoptosis by a mechanism that involves the VDR.\nMoreover, PGE2 prevented up-regulation of the NKG2D and NKp30 receptors on IL-15-activated NK cells, and inhibited the IL-15-induced proliferation and survival of NK cells.\nCellular experiments confirmed that RPS27 inhibition could promote cellular proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of HUVECs, consistent with its downregulation in KS.\nEBV latency proteins, notably LMP1 and EBNA3C, use ubiquitin-mediated mechanisms to inhibit apoptosis, promote cell proliferation, and interfere with DNA repair,", "dois": ["10.1002/jmv.70718", "10.1016/j.anplas.2025.05.013",

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "apoptosis", "key2": "Kidney Cancer", "summary": "Considering that resveratrol can increase the apoptosis of cancer cells alone and in combination with tivozanib and prevent the proliferation of cancer cells and also reduce the side effects of tivozanib, we suggest that resveratrol as a potential bioactive molecule can be used in treatment of kidney cancer should be used in combination with tivozanib.\nHowever, curcumin and its analogues were shown to resensitize kidney cancer cells to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis.\nIn this paper, we show that the molecular machinery responsible for different forms of cell death, such as apoptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis, which are somehow impaired in kidney cancer to allow cancer cell growth and development, was reactivated by targeted pharmacological intervention.\nIn mouse models, monotropein reduced RCC tumor growth, induced apoptosis, and blocked NF-κB pathway.\nApoptosis was induced in BHB-treated cells as caspase-3 and Bax were increased and Bcl-2 was downregulated.\nAdditionally, treatment with the SUV420H2 inhibitor A-196 induced cell apoptosis via upregulation of DHRS2.\nRopivacaine effectively suppressed RCC cell viability, migration and invasion and enhanced cell apoptosis rate.\nThe use of the ERK inhibitor AZD6244 to block the ERK pathway could effectively promote cell apoptosis induced by MTI-31.\nHOXA3 induced RCC cell proliferation, and suppressed autophagy and apoptosis via transcriptionally activating USP15 expression.\nNF-κB pathway dysregulation, a common driver of therapy resistance in cancer, promotes survival by suppressing apoptosis.\nIn addition, HRE inhibited proliferation through promoting apoptosis and P21-induced G/M phase arrest via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.\nIncreased miR-25 levels were associated with decreased expression of ADAMTS16, resulting in enhanced cell viability and diminished apoptosis.\nexperiments verified that LINC00460 downregulation contributed to the growth inhibition of KIRC cell lines and promote", "dois": ["10.1016/j.cellsig.2025.112216",

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "chemotherapy", "key2": "Kidney Cancer", "summary": "Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common pediatric kidney cancer, which presents significant therapeutic challenges, particularly in high-risk cases, due to chemotherapy resistance and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs).\nOur results showed that PON2 downregulation was able to trigger a decrease in proliferation and migration of ccRCC cells, as well as an enhancement of cell sensitivity to chemotherapy.\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common form of kidney cancer, known for its immune evasion and resistance to chemotherapy.\nRenal cell carcinoma (RCC), an aggressive form of kidney cancer resistant to chemotherapy, encounters challenges from immunotherapy resistance and low response rates.\nClear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common form of kidney cancer that often displays resistance to conventional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\nClear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a common kidney cancer with subtle early symptoms, high recurrence rates, and low sensitivity to traditional treatments like radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\nSpecifically, chemotherapy-exposed Wilms tumor specimens exhibited higher levels of PD-L1 expression, and common chemotherapeutics upregulated PD-L1 in vitro.\nAnd the complex tumor microenvironment often promotes tumor progression and induces resistance to chemotherapy.\nHere, we explore how Wilms tumor cells evade the chemotherapy actinomycin D, which inhibits ribosomal RNA biogenesis.\nAfter chemotherapy, the size of the original tumor in the right kidney had decreased in size, as well as the other metastatic lesions.\nStromal type WT showed the lowest median decrease in volume after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (48.1 cm, range 561.5-(+)332.7 cm, p = 0.035).\nFurthermore, our analysis of snRNA and stRNA data unveiled a reduced proportion of RNF34 expression in neoplastic cells after chemotherapy.\nThe adjustment of drug dosing and the tailoring of hemodialysis can increase patients' tolerance while maintaining chemotherapy efficiency.\nTargeting these cells with EGFR inhibitors, in combination with conventional chemotherapy, may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for WT patients.", "dois": ["10.3322/caac.70052", "10.1111/bju.70013",

anti-oxidant response phenotype in HLRCC-associated kidney cancer.\nGlycolytic activity is increased in proliferating cells, leading to the concept that glycolysis could be a therapeutic target in cystic diseases and kidney cancer.\nGlycolysis and antioxidant pathways in kidney cancer are elevated, with frequent mutation of the VHL gene.\nThe hypoxia‑induced upregulation of hsa‑miR‑101 repressed the activity of TIGAR by targeting TIGAR mRNA and promoting glycolysis.\nRNF7 overexpression inhibited apoptosis and promoted glycolysis in vitro and increased tumor growth in vivo by activating the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway by ubiquitination of SOCS1.\nThese results demonstrate that RNF7 inhibited apoptosis, promoted glycolysis, and inhibited sunitinib sensitivity in RCC cells via ubiquitination of SOCS1, thus activating STAT3 signaling.\nApplying SiRCle to a ccRCC cohort, we showed that glycolysis is upregulated by DNA hypomethylation, whilst mitochondrial enzymes and respiratory chain complexes are translationally suppressed.\nFurther, tumor proteomes reflected canonical VHL-driven metabolic reprogramming, including upregulated glycolysis and hypoxia markers, suppressed aerobic metabolism, and dysregulated fatty acid metabolism.\nMetabolic alterations underlying clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) progression include aerobic glycolysis, increased pentose phosphate pathway activity and reduced oxidative phosphorylation.\nWe identified that the inhibition of HMGCR led to an increase in glycolysis via the regulated HSP90 expression levels, thus maintaining the levels of a glycolysis rate-limiting enzyme, pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2).\nSilencing circCOL5A1 could inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of 786-O cells, promote apoptosis,

oxidative metabolism in kidney cancer is associated with inferior outcomes to combination therapy, and that kidney cancer metastases themselves demonstrate elevated oxidative phosphorylation relative to primary tumors.\nMetabolic alterations underlying clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) progression include aerobic glycolysis, increased pentose phosphate pathway activity and reduced oxidative phosphorylation.\nBesides, we observed that overexpression of PTPRG activated oxidative phosphorylation and inhibited apoptosis.\nHigh-CSPI tumors exhibited enhanced tumor stemness phenotypes, metabolic reprogramming (ROS/oxidative phosphorylation), and suppressed immune activity.\nOverexpression of MRPL12 enhances oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and suppresses aerobic glycolysis, while MRPL12 knockdown produces the opposite effects.\nOur findings indicate that the severe compromise of oxidative phosphorylation and rapid glycolytic flux in UOK 262 are an essential feature of this TCA cycle enzyme-deficient form of kidney cancer.\nWe found that treatment with the drugs etomoxir and buformin significantly reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and induced cell death under glucose-deprivation conditions in starvation-resistant RCC cells.\nThe specific PPARα inhibitor GW6471, as well as a siRNA specific to PPARα, attenuates the enhanced fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation associated with glycolysis inhibition, and PPARα antagonism also blocks the enhanced glycolysis that has been observed in RCC cells;\nRNA sequencing (RNAseq) and untargeted

cells.\nPharmacological inhibition of IRS-2 also reduced AKT activation as well as cell viability, clonogenicity, migration, invasion, and adhesion.\nTaken together, inhibited TGFβ1-induced EMT by suppressing the migration and invasion of ccRCC cells via directly targeting gene expression.\nFunctional analyses demonstrate that TWF2 promotes RCC cell invasion, migration, metastasis, and sunitinib resistance by inhibiting the Hippo signaling.\nAdditionally, ZDHHC18 was significantly upregulated in ccRCC tumor tissues, and its knockdown notably inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.\nFunctionally, IRS-2 knockdown attenuated activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and reduced proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, and clonogenicity in FU-UR1 cells.\nWithin RCC, Circ_001024 can promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of RCC cells through the competitive inhibition of miR-145-3p, which controls GLUT5 expression.\nThese findings demonstrate that BPS promotes HK-2 and 786-O cell migration through the WNT5A-dependent EMT pathway, and inhibition of WNT5A expression can suppress this process.\nOur results showed that PON2 downregulation was able to

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "proliferation", "key2": "Kidney Cancer", "summary": "Considering that resveratrol can increase the apoptosis of cancer cells alone and in combination with tivozanib and prevent the proliferation of cancer cells and also reduce the side effects of tivozanib, we suggest that resveratrol as a potential bioactive molecule can be used in treatment of kidney cancer should be used in combination with tivozanib.\nExperimental validation supported these findings, showing that PEBP1 overexpression suppressed the proliferation and migration of kidney cancer cells.\nThrough functional assays, we determined that the suppression of SMARCA4 led to an increase in RCC cell proliferation.\nHOXA3 induced RCC cell proliferation, and suppressed autophagy and apoptosis via transcriptionally activating USP15 expression.\nESRP1 overexpression induced G1-phase arrest and inhibited the proliferation of RCC cells by downregulating cyclin A2 expression.\nrestoring ESRP1 expression can induce cell cycle G1-arrest and inhibit RCC cell proliferation by downregulating cyclin A2 expression;\nMoreover, inhibition of FAK signaling relieves the symptoms of KMN mice, and significantly rescues the enhanced cell proliferation caused by NSD2 overexpression in vitro.\nWithin RCC, Circ_001024 can promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of RCC cells through the competitive inhibition of miR-145-3p, which controls GLUT5 expression.\nKnockdown of KIF14 in A498 cells resulted in reduced proliferation, diminished colony formation capacity, cell cycle arrest, increased apoptosis, and downregulation of CyclinD1 and CDK4.\nThis study aims to fill this gap by demonstrating through a series of experiments that moscatilin can effectively inhibit the proliferation and migration of ccRCC and induce its apoptosis process.\nIn vitro, experiments demonstrated that ARPC1B knockdown suppressed ccRCC cell proliferation and induced apoptosis through the BAX-Bcl-2/c-caspase3/c-PARP axis, which was further validated by in vivo studies.", "dois": ["10.1016/j.jep.2025.120773", "10.1016/j.cellsig.2025.112259",

expression of .\nWe also investigated whether downregulated HOTAIR or DNMT1 reduced proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and migration and increased the apoptosis rate of CML cells.\nThese results demonstrated that shikonin inhibits CML proliferation and migration and induces apoptosis by the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, revealing the effects of shikonin therapy on CML.\nDown-regulation of CD19 could inhibit cell proliferation, adhesion, migration and invasion, and increase cell apoptosis and the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents and imatinib in SUP-B15 cells.\nMigration-associated proteins such as MMP-2 and MMP-9 were upregulated, whereas apoptosis-related protein Bax was downregulated and Bcl-2 protein was not significantly altered in the K562/CD44 cells.\nIn this study, we found that the antisense inhibition of miR-21 in K562 cells suppressed cell migration, promoted cell apoptosis, and inhibited cell growth, and up-regulated the expression of the tumor suppressor gene PDCD4.\nBy contrast, downregulation of p38 MAPK by SB203580 enhanced expression of HO-1 and iNOS and decreased migration of leukemic cells in vitro and their seeding efficiency to vital organs in vivo after injection into immunodeficient mice.\nFAK/Akt pathway activation following integrin β3 (ITGβ3) engagement mediated the migration and invasion of IM-R Adh cells, whereas persistent activation of ERK counteracted BCR-ABL inhibition by imatinib, promoting cell adhesion-mediated resistance.\nStudies recently have shown that the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can induce CML cells to resist TKI therapy by CXCL12/CXCR4 axis from multiple aspects, such as the directional migration of CML cells, adherence to marrow cavity, the mediation of cell protective dormancy, activations of numerous survival signaling pathways, the suppression of mit", "dois": ["10.1016/j.nano.2025.102864", "10.1016/j.bbcan.2025.189366", "10.1016/j.bioorg.2025.108612", "10.3390/ijms26146591",

activation of the Akt/caspase 3 pathway.\nExosomes could serve as biomarkers and therapeutic agents, as well as the molecular mechanisms by which they promote cell growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, immunosuppression, radiation resistance, and chemotherapy resistance in NPC.\nNTNS during NPC radiotherapy is associated with reduced weight loss and severe malnutrition, delayed nutritional risk, alleviated radiotherapy-induced reactions, higher chemotherapy compliance, shortened treatment duration, and improved quality of life.\nThese findings indicated autophagy inhibitors could enhance viability inhibition and apoptotic effects induced by oligonol in NPC cells.\nFurthermore, treatment with autophagy inhibitors 3-methyladenine or LY294002 significantly increased oligonol-induced viability inhibition in NPC-TW01 cells.\nDBT in combination with CCRT for NPC can increase treatment compliance, decrease the treatment-related adverse effects, and alleviate clinical discomfort based on TCM constitution.\nMechanistic studies revealed that high RFC5 expression in NPC cells reduces the formation of micronuclei during cisplatin treatment, thereby suppressing cGAS-STING signaling activation and limiting inflammatory mediator production, which in turn promotes tumor progression.\nThe results demonstrated that the combination of scutellarein and cisplatin increased cell viability inhibition, the number of membrane blebbing cells, the expression of apoptosis markers (cleaved caspase-8, cleaved caspase-7, and cleaved PARP), and the cytokeratin 18 fragment levels compared with treatments with scutellarein or cisplatin alone.\nThis review synthesizes how ferroptosis suppression promotes NPC tumor growth, metastasis, and therapy resistance.\nNanotechnology-based platforms (e.g., BiSe nanosheet hydrogels) further enhance efficacy and reduce toxicity by enabling controlled drug delivery.\nDYNLRB2-AS1 was shown to function as contain an oncogenic lncRNA that promoted NPC GEM resistance, cell proliferation, but inhibited cell apoptosis.", "dois": ["10.1016/j.cellsig.2025.112210", "10.1016/j.rcl.2025.03.019", "10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-2054",

induction chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents.\nThus, combining chemotherapy with inhibitors of DNA damage repair pathways is potentially an ideal strategy for treating leukemia.\nInhibition of CD45 resulted in increased cellular sensitivity to cytarabine and ruxolitinib, the two main therapies for AML and MPN.\nAbstract: Chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT) is a severe complication in patients with cancer that can lead to impaired therapeutic outcome and survival.\nCombination therapy with hypomethylating agents and/or BCL-2 inhibitors are rational next lines of investigation, especially in patients ineligible to receive high-dose chemotherapy.\nThe receipt of genotoxic chemotherapy or radiation, which can promote clonal expansion of mutant clones at the expense of healthy progenitor cells, may result in therapy-related MDS/AML.\nAvailable therapies range from conventional oral chemotherapy to targeted JAK inhibitors to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), the latter representing the only potentially curative modality.\nFinally, it will be shown that the most common form of acute leukemia in PV is due to the inappropriate use of chemotherapy, including hydroxyurea, which facilitates expansion of DNA-damaged, mutated HSC at the expense of their normal counterparts.\nUtilizing an ex vivo EC-HSPC co-culture system with mixed wild-type and JAK2V617F

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "migration", "key2": "Nasopharyngeal Cancer (NPC)", "summary": "AA inhibited NPC cell viability and migration and induced cell death by increasing cleaved caspase-3 expression.\nThe up-regulation of miR-199a-5p can inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of NPC cells, and enhance cell apoptosis.\nThe MiR-3612 mimic inhibited the NPC cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration and also inactivated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.\nEMC2 knockdown promoted ferroptosis, inhibiting cell viability, migration, and invasion, and enhancing the efficacy of cisplatin in NPC cells.\nNPC cells were inhibited in proliferation, migration, invasion, and anti-apoptosis when circ_0007439 was upregulated or miR-556-5p was reduced.\nUpregulation of CEP135 levels in nasopharyngeal cancer cell lines increased cell activity, accelerated cell migration, and inhibited apoptosis.\nMTSS1 is downregulated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) which disrupts adherens junctions leading to enhanced cell migration and invasion.\nNotably, FOXP1 overexpression counteracted the suppressive effects induced by transfection with miRNA-22-3p mimic on HK-1 cell viability and migration.\nGαi1 knockdown reduced cell cycle progression, ERK and Akt-mTOR signaling, inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted apoptosis.\nSOX2 had a binding site on ZIC5, and SOX2 promoted proliferation, migration, and cisplatin resistance and inhibited cell apoptosis by up-regulating ZIC5.\nTHBS1 offset the miR-3612-overexpression-induced repression of the migration, adhesion, and proliferation of NPC cells via the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.\nIn conclusion, ZNF471 inhibits the growth, migration, invasion and stemness of NPC cells, which may be related to its inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation.\nCollectively, these findings indicate that ISL inhibits the migration and invasion of NPC cells associating", "dois":

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "proliferation", "key2": "Nasopharyngeal Cancer (NPC)", "summary": "The up-regulation of miR-199a-5p can inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of NPC cells, and enhance cell apoptosis.\nOur findings indicated that arenobufagin exerted cytotoxic effects on NPC cells, inhibiting proliferation through apoptosis activation.\nUBR5 silencing represses proliferation and glycolysis in NPC.\nDeletion of these enhancers resulted in significant downregulation of TIPE3, leading to reduced proliferation and metastasis of NPC cells.\nCHI3L1 knockdown inhibited NF-κB-dependent inflammatory response and promoting proliferation in NPC cells by inactivating the Akt pathway.\nNPC cells were inhibited in proliferation, migration, invasion, and anti-apoptosis when circ_0007439 was upregulated or miR-556-5p was reduced.\nSalvigenin exerts anti-tumor effects in NPC by inhibiting proliferation, invasion, EMT, and immune evasion via inactivation of the AKT/NF-κB pathway.\nGαi1 knockdown reduced cell cycle progression, ERK and Akt-mTOR signaling, inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted apoptosis.\nRORA overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and glycolysis by directly upregulating SPLUNC1.\nIn conclusion, UBR5 promotes proliferation, glycolysis and M2 polarization by metabolically reprograming NPC cells through suppression of the RORA/SPLUNC1 signaling.\nAstaxanthin significantly suppresses NPC cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, migration, invasion while promoting cell apoptosis by inactivating PI3K/AKT and NF-κB pathways.\nAfter down-regulating hsa_circ_0013561 expression, it significantly inhibited the proliferation and metastasis ability of NPC, inhibited EMT progression, and promoted apoptosis.\nRescue assays further revealed that circCGNL1 inhibited NPC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while increasing apoptosis by suppressing the activation of the AKT/mTOR signaling.", "dois": ["10.1080/15384047.2025.2582349", "10.1016/j.slast.2025.100386", "10.1016/j.intimp.2025.115662", "10.1021/acs.jproteome.5c00793", "10.1080/07357907.2025.2597501",

well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (WD-NETs).\nAlkylating agent-based chemotherapy is one of the main treatment options for patients with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs).\nHowever, it favors the acquisition of a hypermutator phenotype, suggesting a potential benefit of immunotherapy.\nThe combination of PRRT and chemotherapy may enhance treatment efficacy by targeting both somatostatin receptor-positive and FDG-avid tumor cells.\nChemotherapy-induced senescence may promote drug resistance and treatment failure.\nchemotherapy preconditioning may lead to depletion of Tregs, known to suppress immune anti-melanoma responses.\nResearch has shown that chemotherapy-induced cancer cell death may increase immunogenic antigen exposure, or upregulation of co-inhibitory ligands such as PD-L1, thereby augmenting immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy.\nThe administration of chemotherapy to patients with pheochromocytoma can result in adverse side effects and a reduced life quality.\nRLT as first-line treatment could reduce tumor burden rather than maintain stable disease, except in patients who are highly symptomatic where chemotherapy should be considered.\nThe combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy was associated with better outcomes compared to either treatment alone in several cancer thanks to a potential synergy.\nFunctional investigation reveals that CDC25A inhibition suppresses the proliferation of melanoma cells and sensitizes melanoma cells to chemotherapy and NK cell therapy.\nHence, targeting Caspase-3 as a therapeutic approach may enhance the cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapy, but also increase the cancer cell proliferation, metastases and invasion which may works as a double edge sword.\nIn cases of low to moderately metastatic melanoma, a combination of low-dose chemotherapy with CD8T cell immunotherapy effectively targets metastatic lesions, reducing systemic toxicity while promoting a strong immune response.\nPembrolizumab combined with surgical resection, radiotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy may improve the prognosis of patients with treatment-induced large-cell

marginal effect on MCF-7 cells.\nAs cancer cells depend on glycolysis for their energy production, CD147 inhibition might induce cell death specific to cancer cells.\nWe found that CTLA-4 blockade promotes metabolic fitness and the infiltration of immune cells, especially in glycolysis-low tumours.\nTherefore, inhibition of glycolysis might be a promising approach to enhance the anticancer effect of AA by diminishing the generation of pyruvate.\nThese miRNAs were present in HMEX from all six melanoma cell lines and were instrumental in promoting glycolysis and inhibiting OXPHOS in tumour cells.\nThis result indicates that lower pyruvate levels, as a result of glycolysis inhibition, may be responsible for the enhanced effect of 2-DG on AA toxicity.\nConversely, inhibition of glycolysis in Tems not only extended their viability but also augmented desirable properties.\nThese findings indicate that decreasing tumour competition for glucose may facilitate the therapeutic activity of CTLA-4 blockade, thus supporting its combination with inhibitors of tumour glycolysis.\nWe observed a decrease in electron transport protein expression and activity, associated with increased angiogenesis in SDH- and VHL-related, pseudohypoxic tumors, while stimulation of glycolysis was solely observed in VHL tumors.\nTaken together, it is probable that a strategy involving concurrent inhibition of glycolysis in tumor cells and Tems could promote a dual attack on cancer by inducing an effective antitumor immune response and an immunogenic chemotherapy.\nInhibition of CREB phosphorylation in melanoma cells represses glycolytic target genes and induces a switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation that translates into a significant decline in tumor size in vivo in murine melanoma models.\nCollectively, these results indicate that PFKP expression in melanoma cells increases proliferation and glycolytic activity in vitro and promotes tumorigenesis in vivo, suggesting that suppression of PKFP and inhibition of glycolysis may potently suppress melanoma progression.", "dois": ["10.1016/j.bbamcr.2025.120088", "10.1016/j.intimp.2025.115567",

proliferation-associated pathways compared to non-neuroendocrine tumor areas.\nGrade 3 neuroendocrine tumors have a lower Ki-67 proliferation index and tumor mutational burden compared to NECs.\nGrading neuroendocrine tumors using Ki-67 proliferation index (PI) is essential for prognostic assessment and therapeutic decision-making.\nIn the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification, well-differentiated grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors (G3-NETs) are distinguished from poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) based on morphology despite using the same proliferation indices, which poses diagnostic challenges.\nThe 5th edition World Health Organization classification of endocrine and neuroendocrine tumors categorizes MTC into low-grade and high-grade based on tumor necrosis, mitotic figures, and Ki-67 proliferation index, highlighting that histological grading and RET gene mutations are independent prognostic predictors.\nIn vivo studies demonstrate that KA reduces tumor growth and proliferation while promoting apoptosis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for neuroendocrine prostate cancer.\nHNF4α knockdown/knock-in experiments in VMRC-LCD and SBC5 (HNF4α-negative) revealed that HNF4α promoted cell proliferation by inhibiting apoptosis.\nTelotristat ethyl significantly decreased proliferation and serotonin secretion in a dose-dependent manner in GOT1 cells.\nTranscriptome sequencing identified CALCA as a key molecule in the synergistic inhibition of pNETs proliferation by SULF and KMP.\nGastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (GI-NETs) lack effective targeted options beyond somatostatin analogs and mTOR inhibitors.\nBoth GI-NET models expressed SYK and exhibited reduced growth upon SYK blockade, with dose-dependent suppression of viability and increased cytotoxicity relative to vehicle.\nCells were exposed to a selective SYK inhibitor (BI-1002494), and prolif", "dois":

oxidative phosphorylation.\nNPAS2 is upregulated in prostate cancer and promotes cell survival by promoting glycolysis and inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation in PCa cells.\nWe hypothesized that TNFAIP8 promotes prostate cancer (PCa) progression via regulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis.\nFurthermore, inhibition of CSN5 repressed metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in AR-negative prostate cancer cells.\nboth glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation were suppressed after RNAi treatment.\nSmall ankyrin 1 (sANK1) promotes docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells by enhancing oxidative phosphorylation.\nThis study showed that targeting oxidative phosphorylation with metformin can enhance the efficacy of enzalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer in vitro.\nAR activation enhances glucose metabolism, including glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as lipid metabolism in prostate cancer.\nThis decreased glycolytic activity specifically sensitized prostate cancer cells, but not cells representing normal prostate epithelium, to inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation (rotenone and metformin).\noxidative phosphorylation is activated in most cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa).\nSaikosaponin-d mediates FOXG1 to reverse docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer through oxidative phosphorylation.\nIn advanced prostate cancer, an upshift of succinate-driven oxidative phosphorylation via mitochondrial Complex II was reported.\nProstate cancer cells are characterized by a hybrid glycolytic/oxidative phosphorylation phenotype determined by androgen receptor signaling.\nPyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase 1 (PDK1)

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "stemness", "key2": "Prostate Cancer", "summary": "The mechanisms underlying luteolin-induced inhibition of prostate cancer (PCa) stemness have remained elusive.\nWe demonstrated that miR-141-3p appears to be a novel oncogene miRNA, which promotes prostate tumorigenesis and facilitates the stemness of prostate cancer cells via suppressing a key transcription factor kruppel-like factor-9 (KLF9).\nInterestingly, we found that TRIB2 downregulates the luminal markers androgen receptor and cytokeratin 8 in prostate cancer cells but upregulates the neuronal transcription factor BRN2 (Brain-2) and the stemness factor SOX2 (SRY-box 2) to induce neuroendocrine characteristics.\nThis study demonstrated that AGD1, derived from prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs), enhanced the stemness of prostate cancer cells and reduced the therapeutic effect of docetaxel in CRPC.\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that ILs-3, 6 and 11 function as tumor promoters while ILs-10 and 24 function as tumor suppressors in the prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP in vitro, and such differences may attribute to their different effect on the stemness of PCa cells.\nIn prostate cancer mouse models of EMT, Slug expression, as well as WNT/β-Catenin and notch signaling pathways, have been shown to increase stemness potential.\nWe also discuss how Wnt signaling pathways enhances the stemness characteristics of prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) to induce the occurrence and metastasis of CPPC.\nDPYSL5 overexpression in prostate cancer cells induces a neuron-like phenotype, enhances invasion, proliferation, and upregulates stemness and neuroendocrine-related markers.\nThese results suggest that ROS-mediated genotoxic stress is involved in NaAsO-induced cell cycle arrest, stemness enhancement and chemoresistance of prostate cancer cells in a p53-independent manner.\nHere we reported a novel mechanism of CD44 alternative splicing induced by TGF-β1 and its connection to enhance", "dois": ["10.1016/j.taap.2025.117638", "10.1016/j.ejmech.2025.118067", "10.1080/07853890.2024.2442067", "10.3390/ijms262210892", "10.1002/advs.202510602",

metabolome, more specifically, by inhibiting oxidative stress leading to decreased apoptosis.\nIL-8 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and decreases apoptosis, whereas GSK-3β activates the caspase-3 signaling pathway by increasing ROS and thereby induces oxidative stress-mediated cell death.\nThe results of this study highlight the importance of GSK-3β, which increases the production of ROS and thereby induces oxidative stress in tumor cells, whereas IL-8 and mTOR attenuate oxidative stress to protect prostate cancer cells through inhibition of GSK-3β.\nOur results indicate that increased prolidase seems to be related to increased oxidative stress along with decreased antioxidant levels in prostate cancer.\n2D BP inhibited prostate cancer cell survival, meanwhile promoted healthy prostate cell survival in vitro by modulating oxidative stress and immune response with and without near-infrared light (NIR)-irradiation.\nTaken together, dankasterone A induced prostate cancer cells to undergo intense oxidative stress, which resulted in the production of large amounts of HO-1 and the release of large amounts of reactive oxygen species, leading to apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, ultimately resulting in the inhibition of both cell proliferation and migration.\nIn the course of studies aimed at the role of oxidative stress in the development of metastatic potential in the LNCaP-C4-2B prostate cancer progression model system, we found a relative decrease in the level of expression of the cytoplasmic nicotinamide riboside: quinone oxidoreductase (NQO2) and an increase in the oxidative stress in C4-2B cells compared to that in LNCaP or its derivatives C4 and C4-2.\nTBMS1 induces oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in DU145 human prostate cancer cells

significantly inhibited the viability, migration, and invasion of retinoblastoma cells and induced their apoptosis (P<0.05).\nThese findings indicate that SOST silencing promotes the proliferation, invasion and migration, and decreases the apoptosis of human retinoblastoma cells by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.\nIt was observed that treatment with the RPL41 peptide alone decreased the viability, migration, and invasion of retinoblastoma Y79 and Weri-Rb1 cells, in addition to promoting cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.\nOverexpression of miR-613 suppressed retinoblastoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and induced cell cycle arrest in vitro.\nOverexpression of NKILA resulted in decreased, while XIST overexpression resulted in increased proliferation, migration and invasion rates of retinoblastoma cells.\nWe identified the cytokines extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), both with reported immunosuppressive activity, secreted at high levels in retinoblastoma primary cell cultures.\nLnc00152 overexpressing retinoblastoma cells exhibited a tendency to transform

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "migration", "key2": "Rhabdomyosarcoma", "summary": "Low dose PFOA (50 μmol/L) exposure promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion in the human muscle rhabdomyosarcoma cell line through inducing the expressions of MMP2, vimentin and cell cycle related genes.\nThe data suggests that PFOA is a carcinogen capable of promoting RD cell migration and invasion and inhibiting apoptosis through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.\nAlthough RD rhabdomyosarcoma cells express IGF-II, we previously showed that mIGFBP-6 promoted migration through an IGF-independent, p38-dependent pathway.\nMAP kinase pathways are involved in IGFBP-6-induced rhabdomyosarcoma cell migration, so activation of these pathways was studied in HEY and SKOV3 cells.\nCell migration induced by adenosine and AMP is blocked by pertussis toxin, phospholipase C and MAP kinase inhibitor, which demonstrates the importance of these signalling pathways.\nHDAC6 regulates cytoskeletal dynamics to promote tumor cell migration and invasion.\nWe further studied the role of MAP kinases in IGFBP-6-induced migration of Rh30 rhabdomyosarcoma cells, which also express IGF-II.\nUsing NR4A1-responsive rhabdomyosarcoma Rh30 cells as a model, PFOS induced NR4A1-dependent cell proliferation and Rh30 cell migration and invasion.\nThese results suggest that Orai1 signaling is involved in SOCE into rhabdomyosarcoma cells thus contributing to migration, invasion and proliferation.\nWe further explore the significance of this overexpression using a small interferring RNA approach and demonstrate that TBX3 promotes the migratory ability of chondrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and liposarcoma cells but inhibits fibrosarcoma cell migration.\nAltogether, our results describe tumor-promoting mechanisms of growth, migration, and treatment resistance supported by the tumor microenvironment, and offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma.\nMoreover, in assays , anti-CXCR4 blocking antib", "dois": ["10.1038/s41598-025-20994-8", "10.1007/s11010-025-05336-6", "10.1038/s41416-025-03066-6", "10.1038/s41598-025-03466-x",

blocking NCAM expression.\nThese findings suggest that growth and perineural/neural invasion of salivary gland tumors can be blocked by administration of cimetidine via induction of apoptosis and in which NCAM plays a role.\nThe downregulation of NPM1 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in SACC cells.\nHDAC inhibitors together with TNFα also induce apoptosis via TNFα-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in some cancers.\nThe downregulation of metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 expression inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in ACCM cells.\nHDAC7 knockdown resulted in growth inhibition through G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and induced both apoptosis and autophagy in MEC cells.\nDownregulation of CASC9 inhibited SACC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, led to cell arrest at G0/G1 phase, and facilitated cell apoptosis.\nDownregulating GPX1 expression inhibited SACC cell proliferation, chemoresistance, motility, and uPA secretion, but promoted apoptosis via the NF-κB pathway.\nWe found that silencing iNOS down-regulated the expression of VEGF and then inhibited cell growth and invasiveness of SACC cells, while it increased apoptosis.\nAt the molecular level, MECK dramatically reduced myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) in a translation-dependent manner and thereby induced apoptosis through Bax/Bid.\nThe findings of this study indicate that Noxa, activated transcriptionally by p53, suppress the progression of ACC, whereby it regulates proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy.\nIn vitro, a transient overexpression of TβRIII markedly induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, thereby inhibited cell viability and migration of ACC-M cells.\nMA induced an elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) in a

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "chemotherapy", "key2": "Salivary Gland Tumor", "summary": "Adjuvant radiotherapy could help enhance the survival outcomes of these patients while chemotherapy could not.\nCollectively, these results demonstrate that therapeutic inhibition of mTOR ablates cytotoxic-resistant CSCs, and they suggest that a combination of an mTOR inhibitor and platinum-based chemotherapy might be beneficial to patients with salivary gland mucoepidermoid carcinoma.\nIn contrast, conventional chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin, paclitaxel) induced preferential apoptosis of bulk tumor cells and accumulation of CSC.\nRemarkably, temsirolimus slowed down tumor growth and decreased the fraction of CSCs ( < 0.05) even in presence of cisplatin in a short-term in vivo experiment.\nCisplatin also increased the fraction of CSCs in vivo.\nIn contrast, mTOR inhibition (e.g., temsirolimus) blocked cisplatin-induced Bmi-1 expression and salisphere formation in vitro.\nNotably, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin or temsirolimus induced preferential apoptosis of CSC, when compared to bulk tumor cells.\nIn vivo, therapeutic inhibition of mTOR with temsirolimus caused ablation of CSC and downregulation of Bmi-1 expression (major inducer of stem cell self-renewal) in MEC xenografts.\nSalivary gland tumors (SGTs) are heterogeneous tumors that range from benign masses to aggressive high-grade carcinomas with distant metastatic potential and limited response to chemotherapy.\nThese have facilitated the development of targeted therapies, including TRK inhibitors, HER2-directed agents, and androgen receptor modulators, as well as emerging combinations of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.\nFor HER2-negative and AR-negative tumors, or those refractory to either or both targeted approaches, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains a viable option.\nStandard chemotherapy has not been shown to have durable clinical benefits.\nChemotherapy utilization significantly increased from 4.9% to 16.5% over the study period (p < 0.001).\nAdvanced or high-grade MECs are refractory to chemotherapy, often leading to tumor", "dois":

expression.\n5'-NIO inhibited the beta1 Integrin/FAK/Akt pathway which can then facilitate invasion and/or migration of cancer cells through the extracellular matrix (ECM).\nIn vitro, a transient overexpression of TβRIII markedly induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, thereby inhibited cell viability and migration of ACC-M cells.\nTN exhibited the ability to enhance the apoptosis rate through increased caspase-3 activity, elevated levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction, and inhibition of cell migration.\nRhoC silencing may target the downstream ROCK1/p38MAPK/TWIST1 signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting the proliferation, invasion, migration, and EMT of SACC while promoting its apoptosis.\ndownregulation of miR-21 significantly decreased the capacity of invasion and migration of SACC cells, whereas a pre-miR-21 increased the capacity of invasion and migration of SACC cells.\nThe drug, by interfering with the pro-survival NF-κB pathway, hampers cellular proliferation and migration, and favors apoptosis, and can, therefore, be considered a suitable candidate for future experimentation to develop a treatment for salivary gland tumors.\nAdministration of TRK inhibitors suppressed BDNF-induced cell migration in PGC cells.\nIn SACC cell lines, Sphk1 induced cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, and promoted cell migration.\nThe enhanced migration and invasion potential of these cells was abrogated by Akt or TXNRD1 inhibitors.\nThe knockdown of RhoG or Rac1 partially blocked epiregulin-induced migration and

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "apoptosis", "key2": "Sarcoma", "summary": "PA induced apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells through a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential.\nHEA significantly decreased osteosarcoma cell viability and induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner.\nGO-Y030 dose-dependently reduced viability and induced sub-G1 arrest and apoptosis in human osteosarcoma U2OS and 143B cells.\nDownregulation of CREB1 inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation and invasion but induced apoptosis through miRNA-183-5p/PROX1 axis.\nAdditionally, downregulation of ZNF560 resulted in decreased cell viability, fewer colonies, and induced apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells.\nSilencing of BCAR4 inhibited osteosarcoma cell proliferation and migration while promoting cellular apoptosis, primarily mediated by miR-1260a.\nITGB3-KD had a radiosensitizing effect on osteosarcoma in vitro by inhibiting cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion and promoting apoptosis.\nThis study revealed that NEK2 promotes osteosarcoma proliferation, invasion, migration, and chemoresistance while inhibiting apoptosis, likely through AKT/p-AKT signaling.\nThese findings indicated that PA exerts anti-osteosarcoma effects by inhibiting osteosarcoma cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, promoting autophagy and inhibiting PI3K/Akt pathway, suggesting PA as a potential agent against osteosarcoma.\nIn vitro, the Zn-0.8Li scaffold significantly inhibits osteosarcoma progression by suppressing tumor cell proliferation, promoting apoptosis, alleviating migration, and simultaneously promotes osteogenic differentiation through the enhanced expression of osteogenic markers.\nInhibition of the PERK pathway could exacerbate ER stress and promote apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells, while also altering the polarization state of TAMs from the immunosuppressive M2 phenotype to the anti-tumorigenic M1 phenotype, thereby disrupting tumor immunosuppression.", "dois": ["10.3892/mmr.2025.13765", "10.1016/j.ejmech.2025.118355", "10.1080/15384047.2025.2589666", "10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2025.149130", "10.1038/s44321-025-00336-x",

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "chemotherapy", "key2": "Sarcoma", "summary": "Adjuvant chemotherapy in cervical rhabdomyosarcoma has been shown to enhance the overall survival rate of patients undergoing radical surgery\nThis study identifies Rab27aCAF exosomal miR-9-5p as a key oncogenic factor in osteosarcoma, which promotes tumor progression and chemoresistance by suppressing CREBRF and activating the MAPK pathway.\nEvidence has been accumulated with the real-world application of TRK inhibitors in fusion-positive cancers and anti-NGF biologics in bone pain, together with osteosarcoma specimens and functional models showing that NGF/BDNF signaling promotes invasion, angiogenesis, and immunosuppressive niches, while neuromodulatory agents may counter these programs.\nChemotherapy resistance poses a significant challenge in the treatment of osteosarcoma.\nRelapsed or refractory osteosarcoma carries a poor prognosis after standard chemotherapy.\nOnly 30%-40% of high-grade sarcomas respond to initial chemotherapy, which can have significant toxicities.\nThis study found obesity is significantly associated with poor responses to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients.\nOverexpression of HIF-1α decreases overall survival, disease-free survival, and chemotherapy response and promotes tumour stage and metastasis.\nOwing to the lack of sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment of localized chondrosarcoma.\nDespite treatment with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical tumor resection, the prognosis of primary cardiac spindle cell sarcoma remains poor.\nWe uncover neural signatures that are highly representative of clinical rhabdomyosarcoma gene expression programs that are enriched following chemotherapy.\nOsteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents and is often characterized by resistance to chemotherapy.\nOsteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in adolescents, characterized by high rates of recurrence and chemotherapy resistance.\nFunctional assays demonstrated that exosomal miR-9-5p promoted proliferation, cisplatin resistance, cell cycle progression, and inhibited apoptosis in osteos", "dois": ["10.3892/mmr.2025.13765", "10.1002/ijc.70157",

downregulation of metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 expression inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in ACCM cells.\nDownregulation of CASC9 inhibited SACC cell proliferation, migration,

factors.\nThe findings of this study indicate that Noxa, activated transcriptionally by p53, suppress the progression of ACC, whereby it regulates proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy.\nIn the primary SACC, DEC2 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, increased cell population arrested in G0/G1 phase, and participated in dormancy regulation, which limited tumor growth.\nRhoC silencing may target the downstream ROCK1/p38MAPK/TWIST1 signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting the proliferation, invasion, migration, and EMT of SACC while promoting its apoptosis.\nPim-1 siRNA reduces cell

mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.\nThe invasive sarcoma sublines JUN-2fos-3 and JUN-3 show complex metabolic profiles, with activation of both mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis and a significant increase in spared respiratory capacity.\nWe here analyzed the impact of three homoplasmic mtDNA mutations (m.3460G>A/MT-ND1, m.3571insC/MT-ND1 and m.3243A>G/MT-TL1) on osteosarcoma progression, chosen since they induce different degrees of oxidative phosphorylation impairment.\nMetabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, which is also called the Warburg effect, is a hallmark of osteosarcoma (OS) and leads to the enhancement of cell chemoresistance, growth, metastasis, and invasion.\nOsteosarcoma cells carrying such marked CI impairment displayed a reduced tumorigenic potential both in vitro and in vivo, when compared with cells with mild CI dysfunction, suggesting that mtDNA mutations may display diverse impact on tumorigenic potential depending on the type and severity of the resulting oxidative phosphorylation dysfunction.\nConsistently, cisplatin resistant cells exhibit upregulated glycolysis but decreased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, a phenotype called \"Warburg effect\".\nMitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is an obligatory process in sarcoma.\nMetabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis is a hallmark of osteosarcoma (OS).\nConsecutive loss of cell cycle inhibition in immortalized cells resulted in increased levels of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).\nLike other tumors, aggressive soft tissue sarcomas (STS) use glycolysis rather than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for growth.\nHere, we report that KSHV promotes cell survival and cellular transformation by suppressing aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosph", "dois": ["10.1038/s41416-025-03182-3", "10.1002/1878-0261.70002", "10.1038/s41419-025-07903-7",

also found that allicin promotes oxidative stress and autophagy to inhibit osteosarcoma growth by inhibiting the Wnt/-catenin pathway and .\nSilencing the ATG7 gene promoted the proliferation and migration in osteosarcoma cells, suppressing the oxidative stress and ferroptosis process.\nIn conclusion, an increase in oxidative stress and decrease in antioxidant status is observed in both primary bone and soft tissue sarcomas with a similar extent of damage.\nAll data showed that allicin promotes oxidative stress and autophagy of osteosarcoma via the MALATI-miR-376a-Wnt/-catenin pathway.\nThe results suggest that oxidative stress induced by low-dose DOX promotes the invasiveness of osteosarcoma cell line U2OS in vitro, through MMP-9 induction.\nThis study aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms by which UBE2L3 promotes oxidative stress-regulated necroptosis to accelerate the progression of osteosarcoma using in vitro cell experiments.\nThrough these experiments, we aim to evaluate the impact of oxidative stress on necroptosis and uncover the specific mechanisms by which targeted regulation of oxidative stress promotes tumor cell necroptosis as a potential therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma.\nWe show that SHOX expression in U2OS osteosarcoma cells leads to oxidative stress that, in turn, induces lysosomal membrane rupture with release of active cathepsin B to the cytosol and subsequent activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway characterized by mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and caspase activation.\nWe introduce a novel in vitro phenomenon of osteosarcoma (OS) cell line caused by low-dose DOX-induced oxidative stress.\nExposure to RF fields at 4.2 MHz significantly increased the mitochondrial mass and oxidative stress in fibrosarcoma cells.\nFurthermore, we elucidate that the inhibition of STAT3 is mainly induced by ROS-mediated oxidative stress.\nMoreover, the findings of the study indicated that the", "dois":

invasive capacities of A431 squamous cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer.\nBy suppressing the expression of target gene DKK1, miR-130b-3p activated the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, whereby repressing ferroptosis.\nIn particular, we find that ATAD2 inhibition induces ferroptosis in both contexts by downregulating the ferroptosis suppressor GPX4.\nThen we proved that CAMKK2 negatively regulated ferroptosis through the activation of NRF2 and the suppression of lipid peroxidation.\nWe found that inhibition of DCPS by shRNA or RG3039 induced gene transcript alteration and ferroptosis through reducing the mRNA turnover of GLRX.\nIn conclusion, ELK4 enhances proliferation, invasion, and migration while inhibiting ferroptosis in SKCM cells by upregulating CHMP6 transcription.\nWe also show that Arg2 suppresses ferroptosis by activating the Akt/GPX4 signaling pathway, negatively regulating sorafenib-induced cell death in melanoma cells.\nIn vivo experiments confirmed that vemurafenib treatment enhanced PSMB9 expression, increased iron ion accumulation, and suppressed tumor growth via ferroptosis induction.\nThus, T cell-promoted tumour ferroptosis is an anti-tumour mechanism, and targeting this pathway in combination with checkpoint blockade is a potential therapeutic approach.\nAt the same time, the expression of ATF3 protein increased and the expression of NRF2 protein decreased, suggesting that metformin may induce ferroptosis through the ATF3/NRF2 axis.\nFerroptosis, driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO), enhances immunogenicity through damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release and depletion of immunosuppressive cells.\nInterestingly, overexpression of USP14 antagonized all the ferroptosis cascade events induced by MitoCur-1, therefore, we conclude that MitoCur-1 indu", "dois": ["10.2478/aite-2026-0002", "10.1016/j.jconrel.2025.114281", "10.1039/d5cc05288b", "10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-24-1952", "10.1002/jbt.70577",

alternative for topical chemotherapy in skin cancer treatment, offering enhanced therapeutic efficacy.\nResearch has shown that chemotherapy-induced cancer cell death may increase immunogenic antigen exposure, or upregulation of co-inhibitory ligands such as PD-L1, thereby augmenting immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) efficacy.\nAfter the experimental metastasis assay (20 days), the animals inoculated with B16-F1 cells previously exposed at a low concentration to BDE-209 (1 nM), and also under chemotherapy treatment presented an increase in lung mass, colonized lung surface metastases, metastatic lesion index, and downregulation of the tumor suppressor Timp3.\nChemotherapy and surgery are used to treat skin cancer.\nSkin cancer can be treated with chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, etc.\nThe synergy between PAR and dacarbazine, a chemotherapy drug for treating skin cancer, was also assessed.\nClinical research has demonstrated that the integration of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with chemotherapy in the treatment of melanoma can enhance efficacy and reduce toxicity.\nWhile a range of treatment approaches exist, such as chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy, they typically fail to treat skin cancer, particularly in its late stages.\nThe treatment of melanoma demonstrated that GNPs-DOX/R848 significantly reduced tumor volume, enhanced the therapeutic effects of chemotherapy, providing a new approach for the combined treatment of cancer with immunotherapy and chemotherapy.\nBoth in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that HA-PLGA/MXP NPs, under laser irradiation, achieved obviously enhanced therapeutic efficacy, with an ∼81.9 % cell death rate and a ∼95.7 % tumor inhibition rate, outperforming the effects of chemotherapy or photothermal therapy alone.\nThese novel models reclassified 37% of survivors with COG-recommended skin cancer screening as low risk by age 40 years and 29% of survivors

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "glycolysis", "key2": "Skin Cancer", "summary": "The expression of glycolysis-related gene SLC2A1 (also known as GLUT1) was found to be upregulated, while notably WNT5A was downregulated.\nCitrullination thus bypasses normal physiological regulation by low Serine levels to promote excessive glycolysis and reduced cell proliferation.\nAt the metabolic level, treatment with BG11 activated PPARγ and blocked glycolysis in SK-MEL-5 cells, which mediated partial antimelanoma effects of CS4.\nCollectively, KIF22 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and glycolysis and facilitated the apoptosis of melanoma cells by inactivating EGFR/STAT3 signaling.\nWe found that reactivation of melanogenesis using MTyr-OANPs significantly impeded the proliferation of melanoma cells, primarily through the inhibition of glycolysis.\nEnforced expression of miR-370 promotes melanoma cell proliferation, inhibits apoptosis and enhances invasion and glycolysis and led to downregulation of the PDHB protein.\nAdditionally, glycolysis was reduced by KIF22 depletion, evidenced by the decreased ECAR and increased OCR, accompanied by the downregulated expression of HK2, PKM2 and LDHA.\nMetabolic analysis showed that 4-MU affected cellular metabolism through inhibition of glycolysis and enhanced the effect of vemurafenib to reduce the growth of melanoma cells.\nMechanistically, this combination downregulated ERK/AKT signaling, induced apoptosis, and suppressed cellular metabolism at the glycolysis/OXPHOS level, including ATP production.\nOverexpression of glycolysis-related molecules impaired T cell killing of tumor cells, whereas inhibition of glycolysis enhanced T cell-mediated antitumor immunity in vitro and in vivo.\nFurthermore, signaling with initially activated glycolysis and radioresistance in CMM cells was impaired by Santacruzamate A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose, a glycolytic inhibitor.\nUpon T-cell receptor activation, both pathways were upreg", "dois": ["10.1016/j.bbamcr.2025.120088", "10.1016/j.intimp.2025.115567", "10.1111/acel.70239", "10.1002/mc.70049",

compounds significantly reduced cell viability and promoted apoptosis in both cancer cell lines.\nNicotinamide Promotes Apoptosis in Malignant Melanoma via PARP1 Inhibition and Mitochondrial Pathway Activation.\nParthenolide inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis and S-phase cell cycle arrest in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells.\nAZD2811, a selective AURKB inhibitor, induces mitotic dysregulation and apoptosis in MCC cells, with greater efficacy in VP-MCC.\nErianin inhibits cell migration and induces apoptosis by inhibiting VEGF-α/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in malignant melanoma.\nA significant decrease in cell viability is noted in the MB + ZnO NPs group, indicating increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction.\nFollowing VSIG-3/IGSF11 silencing in A2058 cells, viability, proliferation, and migration rates were decreased, while apoptosis was increased.\nThe E7107-exposed UM cell lines exhibited decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis, with the greatest effect on SF3B1-mutated UM cells.\nWe demonstrated that the overexpression of RIPK4 inhibits, while its downregulation enhances, CisPt- or DOX-induced apoptosis in melanoma cells.\nMeanwhile, the expression of the key oncogenic factors DDX5 was also reduced and apoptosis was promoted through the BAX/BCL-2/c-Caspase3 pathway.\nIn vitro findings revealed that (2-methylbutyryl) Shikonin significantly reduced the viability and promoted apoptosis in the B16F10 melanoma cells.\nThe study found that curcumin induced apoptosis in CTCL cells by activating mitochondrial signaling pathways and caspases leading to growth inhibition.\nSTING overexpression or cGAMP treatment significantly reduced cell viability, increased ROS levels, and enhanced apoptosis in irradiate", "dois":

potential multifunctional applications, including photodynamic action, bioimaging, and the inhibition of skin cancer cell proliferation.\nMelanoma, the most lethal form of skin cancer, is commonly associated with mutations in the BRAF gene, particularly BRAFV600E, which drives tumor proliferation via the ERK1/2 signaling cascade.\nThis study suggests that Erianin is a novel compound capable of inducing cell apoptosis while suppressing the activation of the VEGF/PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in A375 cells, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation.\nMacrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an upstream immunoregulatory cytokine that promotes transformed cell proliferation and survival, and generates a tumor-permissive immune landscape of immunosuppressive myeloid and T cells.\nOur findings demonstrated that SASH1 inhibits proliferation, migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and promotes melanin synthesis through TGF-β1 signaling, while THBS1 counteracts the increase in TGF-β1 levels induced by SASH1 knockdown.\nIntriguingly, TTD melanoma cells exhibited reduced proliferation and an increased signature of the melanocyte lineage factor MITF, along with a strong basal upregulation of REDD2, an inhibitor of the mTOR/S6K/4EBP1-dependent messenger RNA (mRNA) translation machinery.\nIts downregulation suppresses the protective effect of the autophagy-initiating ULK1 and AMBRA1, regulators of normal cell survival and proliferation, and upregulates the sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62), an autophagic cargo adapter which mediates selective degradation of ubiquitinated proteins.\nWe provide strong evidence that ZNF224 overexpression in melanoma cell lines positively modulated p21(CIP1/WAF1) gene transcription in a p53-dependent manner

{"pair_type": "pathway_disease", "key1": "chemotherapy", "key2": "pancreatic tumor growth", "summary": "In conclusion, ILK was upregulated with resistance and may be involved in tumor angiogenesis, invasive potential, and chemotherapy resistance, which were all suppressed by Cpd22 treatment.\nthe hybrid lipoplexes showed effective anticancer activity by reducing the BxPC-3 pancreatic tumor growth by 99% through the synergetic combination of chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and gene therapy.\nFunctional experiments revealed that downregulating the expression of FAT10 inhibits the proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PC cells, promotes the apoptosis of PC cells, and enhances sensitivity to gemcitabine chemotherapy.\nInhibiting KLF5 significantly enhances the cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin rather than other chemotherapy drugs.\nCM272 also enhanced chemotherapy sensitivity and significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo without detectable toxicity.\nSTAT3 inhibition enhanced the sensitivity of PCCs to the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine by suppressing EMT and immune escape and inducing OS damage.\nAdvanced breast cancer frequently metastasizes to bone, but inhibiting tumor progression in chemotherapy may occasionally enhance tumorigenesis.\nThe matrix-rich \"deserted\" subTMEs harbored fewer activated fibroblasts and tumor-suppressive features yet were markedly chemoprotective and enriched upon chemotherapy.\nConsistent with the importance of autophagy in PDAC, autophagy inhibition significantly enhances response of PDAC patients to chemotherapy in two randomized clinical trials.\nIn addition, GS is overexpressed in human non-small cell lung cancer and its depletion reduces tumor growth in mice and increases the efficacy of microtubule-targeted chemotherapy.\nCancer-associated cachexia (CAC) is the nutrition-independent loss of lean muscle and adipose tissues, and results in reduced chemotherapy effectiveness and increased mortality.\nSince inhibition of DNA repair enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy, we aimed to investigate the anticancer potential of BBIT20 against PDAC, particularly carrying wtBRCA.\nOverexpression of CARD9 promotes proliferation and invasion of QBC939 and RBE cells, enhances the growth and development in CCA", "dois": ["10.3892/or.2025.9033",

MUC1-C regulates self-renewal and redox balance by integrating activation of glycolysis with suppression of oxidative phosphorylation.\nMoreover, we identified that CPT inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial fusion via autophagy and transcriptional activation of the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) pathway.\nIts mechanism of action involves mitochondrial impairment and the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), achieved through direct binding to C1QBP, thereby promoting its ubiquitin-dependent degradation.\nWe developed and characterised the efficacy of novel AMPK activator (SU212) that selectively induces oxidative phosphorylation and decreases glycolysis in TNBC cells, while not affecting these pathways in normal cells.\nUsing coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering and two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy, we show that CDCP1 depletes lipids from cytoplasmic lipid droplets (LDs) through reduced acyl-CoA production and increased lipid utilization in the mitochondria through FAO, fueling oxidative phosphorylation.\nWe observed that the MYC-suppressed persistent triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells are metabolically flexible and can upregulate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes and respiratory function (\"OXPHOS-high\" cell state) in response to DNA-damaging anthracyclines such as doxorubicin, but not to taxanes.\nRNA sequencing and Ingenuity Pathway Software Analysis (IPA) of the transcriptomic data revealed several upregulated and downregulated gene

protein and mRNA levels, whereas CAPN-2 suppressed proliferation.\nIn vitro, LINC02544 silencing via exo/si-LINC02544 reduced CAPRIN1 levels, upregulated miR-497-5p, and inhibited TNBC cell proliferation and migration.\nUSP33 was significantly downregulated in TNBC tissues and cell lines, correlating with enhanced proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.\nBy inhibiting FAK activation and upregulating PIK3IP1, Ifebemtinib and paclitaxel blocked the PI3K/Akt pathway, effectively suppressing TNBC proliferation and metastasis.\nIn vitro, FGF4 activated IL6/STAT3 signaling, inducing macrophage polarization to an M2 phenotype with elevated IL-10/TGF-βsecretion and suppression of T cell proliferation.\nSpecifically, the combination therapy inhibits FOXC2-driven EMT and induces ferroptosis via the FOXC2-Hippo signaling axis, suppressing tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion.\nThese limit metastasis, induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, and reverse chemoresistance by altering vital pathways like PI3K/AKT/ mTOR, MAPK/ERK, NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and Wnt/β-catenin.\nTAS-115 significantly reduced cell proliferation and viability, enhanced apoptosis, and suppressed c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition/hepatocyte growth factor and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling.\nThe PLGA nanoparticles loaded with MP-1 targeted the PD-L1 effectively and modulated the Molecular Pathways related with EMT which inhibit tumor cell proliferation and enhance their apoptosis.\nPE32 can effectively inhibit the proliferation and migration of TNBC cells, and can induce PANoptosis in TN", "dois": ["10.1016/j.bioelechem.2025.109153", "10.1016/j.jsbmb.2025.106904", "10.1016/j.ejmech.2025.118370", "10.1016/j.ejmech.2025.118287", "10.1016/j.taap.2025.117659",

stemness.\nMALAT1 downregulated DNMT1 by miR-137/BCL11A pathway to enhance TNBC stemness and tumorigenesis;\nFurthermore, inhibitor of SHH pathway or Gli1 siRNA attenuated the promoting effects of BPS on stemness, invasion, and migration of TNBC cells.\nWe demonstrate that Z8 suppresses TNBC tumor growth via a mechanism that reactivates the Hippo pathway and decreases TNBC ALDH cell stemness and viability.\nThe combination also enhanced autophagic activity by inhibiting the AKT/mTOR pathway and reduced cell migration and stemness by suppressing the EMT process.\nFunctional experiments revealed that MALAT1 inhibited DNMT1 expression through acting on the miR-137/BCL11A pathway to enhance TNBC stemness and tumorigenesis.\nDLL4-derived MDSCs promoted stemness-mediated drug resistance by inducing histone lactate modification in TNBC, suppressing the anti-tumor activities of CD8T cells.\nOverexpression of TRIM58 reduced the proportion of CD44 + /CD24- cells, upregulated differentiation genes, and inhibited stemness-related gene expression in TNBC CSCs.\nTaken together, these findings underscore the role of CCNE1 in promoting TNBC cell stemness and progression via competitive inhibition of FZR1-mediated ANLN ubiquitination.\nTaken together, these results highlight that FBXW7 degrades CHD4 protein through ubiquitination, thereby blocking the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to inhibit the stemness of TNBC cells.\nWe demonstrated that LFS-1107 can induce the nuclear retention of Survivin and consequent strong suppression of STAT3 transactivation abilities and the expression of downstream stemness regulators.\nIn vivo data confirmed that ALKBH5 upregulated UBE2C expression by regulating the m6A modification of", "dois":

(MAPK)-mediated apoptosis in a rat model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and in vitro.\nWe evaluated the potential function and molecular mechanism of Omi in ureteral obstruction-induced kidney epithelial cell apoptosis and fibrosis.\nEpigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a polyphenol extracted from green tea, has been shown to inhibit renal fibrosis in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice, but its role in preventing tubular cell apoptosis and the underlying signaling mechanisms still remains unclear.\nApoptosis occurred early in partial unilateral ureteral obstruction and decreased later.\nUreteral obstruction increased apoptosis in affected ureters, with peristaltic function halted following all periods of obstruction.\nOxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress may induce renal apoptosis and contribute to the pathogenesis of the kidney with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO).\nExacerbated oxidative stress and inflammation may induce three types of programmed cell death, autophagy, apoptosis and pyroptosis in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) kidney.\nAblation of L3mbtl2 in renal tubular cells resulted in increases in nuclear DNA damage, p53 activation, apoptosis, tubular injury and kidney dysfunction after cisplatin treatment or unilateral ureteral obstruction.\nAlthough the relief of ureteral obstruction seems to be a radical treatment for obstructive uropathy (OU), progressive kidney damage is the result because of the associated increased apoptosis and fibrosis.\nKnockdown of LMX1B aggravated the expression of fibrosis markers,
